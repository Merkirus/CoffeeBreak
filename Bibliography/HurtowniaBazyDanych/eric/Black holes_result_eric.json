        "description":"Scientists using NASA's Swift satellite say they have found newborn black holes, just seconds old, in a confused state of existence. The holes are consuming material falling into them while somehow propelling other material away at great speeds. \"First comes a blast of gamma rays followed by intense pulses of x-rays. The energies involved are much greater than anyone expected,\" says David Burrows of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). These gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful explosions known. They are forerunners of a massive star explosion called a hypernova, which is bigger than a supernova. Using Swift, scientists are finally able to see gamma-ray bursts within minutes after the trigger, instead of hours or days, and are privy to newborn black hole activity. Until this latest discovery, scientists assumed a simple scenario of a single explosion followed by a graceful afterglow of the dying embers. Several theories exist to describe this newly discovered phenomenon and most point to the presence of a newborn black hole.",

Einstein's prediction of the deflection of light as it passes near the Sun was verified by observations made during the solar eclipse of 1919. Another prediction was that of gravitational redshift, which occurs when light emitted by a star loses energy in the gravitational field of its source. If all of its energy is lost in this way, a black hole is formed. A star at the end of its evolutionary process can form a black hole if its mass is sufficiently large. Gas accreted from its surroundings by a stellar-mass black hole can become hot enough to emit high-energy radiation, which can be observed in X-ray astronomy.\"Supermassive\" black holes could exist at the centres of galaxies--infrared observations have suggested the presence of one in our own galaxy--while others could exist in \"active galaxies\", including quasars.
