        "author":["Kweldju, Siusana"],
        "description":"In the past, neurobiology for reading was identical with neuropathology. Today, however, the advancement of modern neuroimaging techniques has contributed to the understanding of the reading processes of normal individuals. Neurobiology findings today have uncovered and illuminated the fundamental neural mechanism of reading. The findings have helped researchers and educators in the field of reading expand their understanding of the different levels of the reading process for evidence-based reading instruction. The aims of this paper are to provide a review of the results of neuroscience laboratory research for understanding the reading process. First, the subprocesses of reading and the activated areas of the brain at every stage of reading are discussed. Second, the paper indicates how reading involves both linguistic and non-linguistic processing, and the interconnectivity of the cognitive and emotional networks, which takes place, from the visual recognition of letters to comprehension at the discourse level, and to articulation. An overview of research on the neurobiology of reading such as this will contribute to the understanding of the overall neural basis of reading and has the potential to be integrated into a model of automatic reading and reading comprehension.",

        "description":"There is growing interest amongst educationalists in the relationship between education and neuroscience; for example, the Society for Research into Higher Education (SRHE) recently hosted an event entitled \"Bridging the gap between neuroscience and education\". While students' quotations are informative about what promotes or facilitates their learning, and what inhibits it, they do not reveal anything about the neurobiology that underlies their construction of knowledge and understanding. In this article, qualitative data from bioscience students on their undergraduate learning experiences are considered in the light of insights into the structure and function of the brain, which neuroscience can provide, in order to enrich our understanding of learning and teaching. Consideration of the neurobiology of learning demonstrates that the way in which students experience their learning environments can significantly alter their ability to learn by affecting the neurobiological capabilities of their brains.",

Behavioral neurobiology and neuropsychiatry provide a systems-level framework that allows teachers to integrate biology, psychodynamics, and psychology. Method: The authors detail the underlying assumptions and outline of a neural systems-based neuroscience course they teach at the National Capital Consortium Psychiatry Residency Program. They review course assessment reports and classroom observations. Results: Self-report measures and teacher observations are encouraging. By the end of the course, residents are able to discuss both neurobiological and psychodynamic/psychological concepts of distributed biological neural networks. They verbalize an understanding that psychology \"is\" biology, that any distinction is artificial, and that both are valuable. Conclusions: A neuroscience curriculum founded on the underlying principles of behavioral neurobiology and neuropsychiatry is inherently anti-reductionistic and facilitates the acquisition of detailed information as well as critical thinking and cross-disciplinary correlations with psychological theories and psychotherapy.",

        "author":["Durston, Sarah",
          "Konrad, Kerstin"],
        "description":"This paper aims to illustrate how combining multiple approaches can inform us about the neurobiology of ADHD. Converging evidence from genetic, psychopharmacological and functional neuroimaging studies has implicated dopaminergic fronto-striatal circuitry in ADHD. However, while the observation of converging evidence from multiple vantage points is convincing, it does not necessarily inform us on how these observations fit together. How does a polymorphism in a (dopamine) risk-gene for ADHD translate into a neurobiological substrate and result in behaviors that warrant a diagnosis of ADHD in a developing child? To illustrate how integrating multiple methods may help address this issue, we discuss studies combining genetics, neuropsychopharmacology and neuroimaging approaches. We show how investigators are using these approaches to map the effects of ADHD risk-genes, and common ADHD-treatments on neurobiological measures. Given its central role in both ADHD and in stimulant treatment, the dopamine transporter gene is frequently discussed as an example. The studies discussed here demonstrate that a converging methods approach is a potentially powerful tool in unraveling the neurobiology of ADHD. These approaches may suggest new avenues for research, as well as point out new directions for the development of targeted treatments for this disorder.",

        "description":"Political science and its subfields cannot ignore the work being done in two areas of the life sciences: sociobiology and neurobiology. Current theories of political socialization which suggest that society molds the child will be increasingly affected by sociobiological theory which posits that children operate as independent actors in the socialization process. However, both the social sciences and sociobiology may have to be emended in the light of the emerging field of neurobiology. Leading neuroscientists not only indirectly support the sociobiological contention that children may play an active role in the socialization process, but also they tend to see the brain in emergent, dualistic, and mentalist terms. That is, the mind exists as a separate entity from the physical  brain and is not reducible to it. Thus, three implications of neurobiological theory that apply even beyond children and politics to all humans and all behavior must be considered: (1) children are independent actors in the socialization process; (2) self-consciousness, as the child matures, may play an increasingly independently important role in the behavior of the child; and (3) the role of children in the socialization process and of self-consciousness in human (political) behavior must be considered in the light of genetic variability.

Recent developments in fragile X research have provided new insights and knowledge about the physiological function of FMRP in the cell and the nerve cell in particular. Currently, compelling evidence suggests a role for FMRP in the transport/translation of dendritically localized mRNAs. In addition, the identification of some of the target mRNAs of FMRP have led to an increased interest in the neurobiology of the syndrome. This review highlights the role of FMRP in dendritic mRNA transport/translation in relation to synaptic plasticity, a molecular mechanism implicated in learning and memory. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Since WW2, degradation of our global natural systems has been on the increase. Much of this degradation has been communicated to the general public via mainstream media and yet human behaviours do not seem to have changed significantly as a result. It is argued in this paper that the manner in which our brains and minds work, in particular in regard to the \"neuroplasticity\" of the brain's pathways, may contribute to this lack of changed behaviour. Current research on neuroplasticity and more generally neuroconstructivism is examined. It is then postulated that we can take advantage of what might appear to be a limitation of neurobiology by a/ helping the developing mind create meta-values such as \"having a positive regard towards natural systems\" that would then be defended by the adult brain and b/ applying the concept of embodiment during instruction. This paper will provide a growth sequence for lifelong ecological consciousness that incorporates the manifestations of neurobiology as well as current research involving nature-embedded, embodied experience. This growth sequence will provide educators at all levels (i.e. lifelong) with an enriched framework that will assist the learner at various stages of life in becoming a more ecologically discerning global citizen. The implication for educators is that we need to understand how each stage of life (i.e. early childhood to adult) is interdependent on preceding stages and interconnected with all stages as opposed to focussing only on individual stages of cognitive development.

        "author":["Sankey, Derek"],
        "description":"Are there neurobiological reasons why we are willing to trust other people and why &quot;trust&quot; and moral values such as &quot;care&quot; play a quite pivotal role in our social lives and the judgements we make, including our social interactions and judgements made in the context of schooling? In pursuing this question, this paper largely agrees with claims made by Patricia Churchland in her 2011 book &quot;Braintrust&quot;. She believes that moral values are rooted in basic brain circuitry and chemistry, which have been shaped over evolutionary time. However, these naturalistic claims raise important issues, including the standard philosophical objection that they fall victim to the naturalistic and/or deontic fallacies. This paper provides an overview of the neurobiology of trust and examines some of the main objections, in the belief that recognising the neurobiological substrate of care and trust can deepen our appreciation of the role these play in education.",

        "description":"This study reviews recent research related to the neurobiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) an provides an empirical analysis of current assessment practices. Data were collected through a survey of 117 school psychologists. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS), and Gilliam Asperger's Disorder Scale (GADS) were the most frequently used measures. Among the less popular, but more intensive instruments, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) appears to be gaining popularity within school-based evaluations. Generally, respondents approached the assessment of ASDs from a traditional psychoeducational perspective and reported the use of a very narrow range of ASD-specific instruments. Concerns are raised regarding the inconsistent inclusion of developmental questionnaires, parent/guardian interviews, and medical professionals in the ASD evaluation process. Implications for practice and the training of school psychologists are discussed. (Contains 3 tables)",
