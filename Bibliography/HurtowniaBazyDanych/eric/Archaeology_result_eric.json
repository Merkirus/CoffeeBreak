Introductory notes assess the value of critical thinking and inter-disciplinary exploration in archaeology. Narrative information on the history and theory of archaeology are followed by task cards designed to be given to students for independent pursuit in archaeology. Each card contains information on subject, objectives, introduction, activities, and materials needed. Sample topics include hieroglyphics, salvage archaeology, archaeological techniques, language, cultural universals, historical research, interpretation of artifacts, and cultural development of American Indians.

        "description":"How could handchipped stones, ancient ruins, old broken dishes, and antiquated garbage help students learn about the world and themselves? Within archaeology, these seemingly irrelevant items can enlighten students about the world around them through science, culture, and history. When teaching archaeology in the classroom, educators can lead students on learning adventures while engaging them in thinking about life in the past and who they are as humans today. This ERIC Digest discusses: (1) the discipline of archaeology; (2) archaeology in the classroom; and (3) resources for teaching archaeology. The Digest defines archaeology, describes the archaeological process, and explains the wide range of topics covered when teaching archaeology. Resources are available for educators to  integrate archaeology into their lessons, and several organizations, including the Society for American Archaeology (SAA), are listed, including the mailing address, and/or web site address. In-depth information about SAA is provided, including publications and a Web site address of the network of State and Provincial Archaeology Education Coordinators supported by SAA. Information is given about programs and courses that allow educators to participate in ongoing archaeological projects and synthesize what they learn in the field into their teaching. (LB)",

First, she prominently displayed archaeology books in the library, including Ancient Times by Guy Austrian and Archaeology for Kids by Richard Panchyk. After explaining the definition of archaeology to them, the students and Robinson searched the Web and several magazines, like Science News and Scientific American, and uncovered that there were more than 20 different archaeology specializations. This article briefly describes Robinson's 10-week lesson.",

        "description":"Archaeology is a highly interdisciplinary field. Its main goal is to construct culture histories, but it uses many scientific methods in the process. Ethical dilemmas inherent in archaeology make it a good vehicle for teaching ethics and character in the classroom (Moe 2000). The interdisciplinary nature of the field makes it possible to weave ethics and character throughout the curriculum, using archaeology as a theme. Recognizing the potential of archaeology to teach ethics in a meaningful way, Utah Project Archaeology, the Utah State Office of Education, and the Utah Museum of Natural History formed the Ethics and Archaeology Partnership to explore ways to use archaeology to teach ethics, character, and citizenship in a series of professional development opportunities for Utah educators in grades K-12. This article describes the partnership and the lessons learned by participants.",

Design/methodology/approach: To meet the purpose of this multiple-case study, optional archaeology course development (2011-2019) and students' questionnaires and feedback group A (2018) and group B (2019) and various empirical material, was analysed in cross-case methods. Findings: Archaeology interdisciplinarity and analysing long-term human behaviour supports an understanding of human nature, emphasizes empathy and tolerance, and encourages social cohesion. Research limitations/implications: The study was carried out in Estonia as a multiple-case study and further research, especially in the empathy part, is needed for further conclusions. Practical implications: Archaeology is interdisciplinary and therefore as a school subject it links together various and sometimes abstract subjects. It gives an understanding of long-term human behaviour, which allows developing students' empathy and tolerance.",

        "description":"This special issue of the bulletin &quot;Early Georgia&quot; provides a partnership of educators and archaeologists to show how archaeology can be translated into the classroom. The multidisciplinary nature of archaeology allows Georgia educators to address many of the Quality Core Curriculum objectives mandated by the state. The book is divided into four chapters, including: (1) &quot;Narratives,&quot; written by educators, based on their experiences with archaeology in the classroom; (2) &quot;Exercises,&quot; offering exercises and activities to be included in multidisciplinary curriculums; (3) &quot;Bibliographic and Curriculum Materials,&quot; containing a list of sources for educators ranging from books and exhibits to curriculum materials; and (4) &quot;Archaeological Ethics,&quot; summarizing ethical principles that  should guide the practice of archaeology.
