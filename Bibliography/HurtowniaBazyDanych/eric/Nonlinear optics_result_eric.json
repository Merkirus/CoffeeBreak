        "description":"Nonlinear optics is generally first presented as an extension of conventional optics. Typically the subject is introduced with reference to a classical oscillatory electric polarization, accommodating correction terms that become significant at high intensities. The material parameters that quantify the extent of the nonlinear response are cast as coefficients in a power series--nonlinear optical susceptibilities signifying a propensity to generate optical harmonics, for example. Taking the subject to a deeper level requires a more detailed knowledge of the structure and properties of each nonlinear susceptibility tensor, the latter differing in form according to the process under investigation. Typically, the derivations involve intricate development based on time-dependent perturbation theory, assisted by recourse to a set of Feynman diagrams. This paper presents a more direct route to the required results, based on photonic rather than semiclassical principles, and offers a significantly clearer perspective on the photophysics underlying nonlinear optical response. The method, here illustrated by specific application to harmonic generation and down-conversion processes, is simple, intuitive and readily amenable for processes of arbitrary photonic order.

        "author":["Garver, Wayne"],
        "description":"It is well known that when two waves are added they produce beats. These beats are the amplitude modulation of the initial waves and occur periodically at a rate equal to the frequency difference of the two waves. Acoustical beats arise from sound waves of nearly equal frequencies. Optical beats arise from the interference of two light waves of nearly equal frequencies. Despite these examples, adding two waves does not always create a new wave at the beat frequency--a heterodyne wave. A heterodyne wave is, however, created only when the wave amplitudes combine nonlinearly. The resulting heterodyne wave can be identified because it is an additive term at a new frequency in the output waveform. An electrical circuit provides a unique opportunity to understand the responses of linear and nonlinear devices (resistors and diodes) to the sum of two sinusoidal waves. Using the resistor, the output frequencies are the same while the diode creates new (heterodyne) frequencies. A speaker in the circuit provides an audio demonstration of the difference between the devices.",

        "description":"The authors provide a didactic treatment of nonlinear (categorical) principal components analysis (PCA). This method is the nonlinear equivalent of standard PCA and reduces the observed variables to a number of uncorrelated principal components. The most important advantages of nonlinear over linear PCA are that it incorporates nominal and ordinal variables and that it can handle and discover nonlinear relationships between variables. Also, nonlinear PCA can deal with variables at their appropriate measurement level; for example, it can treat Likert-type scales ordinally instead of numerically. Every observed value of a variable can be referred to as a category. While performing PCA, nonlinear PCA converts every category to a numeric value, in accordance with the variable's analysis level, using optimal quantification. The authors discuss how optimal quantification is carried out, what analysis levels are, which decisions have to be made when applying nonlinear PCA, and how the results can be interpreted. The strengths and limitations of the method are discussed. An example applying nonlinear PCA to empirical data using the program CATPCA (J. J. Meulman, W. J. Heiser, &amp; SPSS, 2004) is provided.",

        "description":"Electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) were used to assess age-associated differences in nonlinear brain dynamics during both rest and auditory oddball performance in children aged 9.0-12.8 years, younger adults, and older adults. We computed nonlinear coupling dynamics and dimensional complexity, and also determined spectral alpha power as an indicator of cortical reactivity. During rest, both nonlinear coupling and spectral alpha power decreased with age, whereas dimensional complexity increased. In contrast, when attending to the deviant stimulus, nonlinear coupling increased with age, and complexity decreased. Correlational analyses showed that nonlinear measures assessed during auditory oddball performance were reliably related to an independently assessed measure of perceptual speed. We conclude that cortical dynamics during rest and stimulus processing undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to old age, and propose that lifespan age differences in nonlinear dynamics during stimulus processing reflect lifespan changes in the functional organization of neuronal cell assemblies.",

Instead, the participants  appeared to be trapped in persistent and futile attempts to abstract the cue-criterion  relations. Only after being instructed to rely on exemplar memory in Experiment 2 did they  master the nonlinear task.

In addition, challenges for nonlinear pedagogy and a discussion on how nonlinear pedagogy support the work of physical education (PE) teachers will be shared. Evidence from the increasing volume of work on nonlinear learning from motor learning literature is used to suggest how acquisition of movement skills is supported by nonlinearity. The emergence of goal-directed behaviors is a consequence of the performer, environmental, and task constraints. With a nonlinear pedagogy approach, the focus is on the individual learner where opportunities for meaningful actions can be learnt. Design principles based on representativeness, focus of attention, functional variability, manipulation of constraints, and ensuring relevant information-movement couplings can be delivered via pedagogical channels of instructions, practices, and feedback to the learners. Importantly, this focus on the individual sets the foundation for a developing nonlinear pedagogy framework to enhance teaching in PE although the challenges are non-trivial.",

Method: Three materially linear and 3 materially nonlinear models were created and stretched up to 10 mm in 1-mm increments. Phonation onset pressure (P[subscript on]) and F[subscript 0] at P[subscript on] were recorded for each length. Measurements were repeated as the models were relaxed in 1-mm increments back to their resting lengths, and tensile tests were conducted to determine the stress-strain responses of linear versus nonlinear models. Results: Nonlinear models demonstrated a more substantial frequency response than did linear models and a more predictable pattern of F[subscript 0] increase with respect to increasing length (although range was inconsistent across models). P[subscript on] generally increased with increasing vocal fold length for nonlinear models, whereas for linear models, P[subscript on] decreased with increasing length. Conclusion: Nonlinear synthetic models appear to more accurately represent the human vocal folds than do linear models, especially with respect to F[subscript 0] response.",

        "description":"A cubication procedure of the nonlinear differential equation for conservative nonlinear oscillators is analysed and discussed. This scheme is based on the Chebyshev series expansion of the restoring force, and this allows us to approximate the original nonlinear differential equation by a Duffing equation in which the coefficients for the linear and cubic terms depend on the initial amplitude, A, while in a Taylor expansion of the restoring force these coefficients are independent of A. The replacement of the original nonlinear equation by an approximate Duffing equation allows us to obtain an approximate frequency-amplitude relation as a function of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. Some conservative nonlinear oscillators are analysed to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of this scheme. (Contains 3 footnotes and 5 figures.)",

        "description":"A study examined the role of technicians in the fiber optics industry and determined those elements that should be included in a comprehensive curriculum to prepare fiber optics technicians for employment in the Texas labor market. First the current literature, including the ERIC database and equipment manufacturers' journals were reviewed. After the continuum of job tasks required for fiber optics technicians was identified, the occupational skills required of fiber optics technicians in the Texas labor market were analyzed through a users' survey. An advisory committee of representatives of business/industry technical educators, other educators, and Texas Education Agency personnel was formed. Data from the literature search, advisory committee input, and site visits to fiber  optics plants in Texas and a fiber optics conference were incorporated into recommendations concerning an appropriate training curriculum for fiber optics technicians and suggested methods for providing services to special needs students. Finally, all materials developed during the project were validated. (Appendixes to this report, which comprise more than half the document, include the industry needs survey, and equipment list for training stations, a list of fiber optics manufactures, quarterly project reports, a task analysis, and a list of advisory committee members.)
