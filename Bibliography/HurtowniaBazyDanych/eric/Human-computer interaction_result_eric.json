        "author":["Sundar, S. Shyam"],
        "description":"Conducted in the attribution-research paradigm of social psychology, a study examined whether human-computer interaction is fundamentally social (as in human-human interaction) or parasocial (as in human-television interaction). All 30 subjects (drawn from an undergraduate class on communication) were exposed to an identical interaction with computers. In one condition, subjects were told they were dealing with computers; in another, they were told they were interacting with programmers. Each subject was tutored by two different computers on two topics and evaluated by the computers. The first set of evaluations praised the subject four out of five times, the second set of evaluations criticized the subjects four out of five times. Psychological differences were found between  conditions, suggesting human-computer interaction to be social rather than parasocial. Users tended to respond to computers as though the computers were other humans, and dealing with computers is more like interpersonal communication rather than like mass communication. Further research should expand on this study by adding another condition wherein subjects are led to believe that they are interacting with a live tutor/evaluator in another room. Depending on whether this condition is closer to the computer condition or the programmer condition, theories about the socialness of human-computer interaction can be generated.

Chatterbots based on dialogue management and developed with AI, TTS technology, and computer animation can engage the learner in computer-simulated human-human conversations. Its natural language social interaction opens new horizons for spoken language teaching/learning. A classroom survey was conducted in which the students showed keen interest and computer-simulated human-human interaction was frequently observed. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)",
