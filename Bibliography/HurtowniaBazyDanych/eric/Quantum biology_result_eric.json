        "description":"Fluorescent proteins are commonly used in cell biology to assess where proteins are within a cell as a function of time and provide insight into intracellular protein function. However, the usefulness of a fluorescent protein depends directly on the quantum yield. The quantum yield relates the efficiency at which a fluorescent molecule converts absorbed photons into emitted photons and it is necessary to know for assessing what fluorescent protein is the most appropriate for a particular application. In this work, we have designed an upper-level, biochemistry laboratory experiment where students measure the fluorescence quantum yields of fluorescent proteins relative to a standard organic dye. Four fluorescent protein variants, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), mCitrine, and mCherry, were used, however the methods described are useful for the characterization of any fluorescent protein or could be expanded to fluorescent quantum yield measurements of organic dye molecules. The laboratory is designed as a guided inquiry project and takes two, 4 hr laboratory periods. During the first day students design the experiment by selecting the excitation wavelength, choosing the standard, and determining the concentration needed for the quantum yield experiment that takes place in the second laboratory period. Overall, this laboratory provides students with a guided inquiry learning experience and introduces concepts of fluorescence biophysics into a biochemistry laboratory curriculum.",

The focus is on new ways about thinking about organizations. The introduction and chapter 1 introduce three branches of science and their contributions to understanding--quantum physics, self-organizing systems, and chaos theory. Chapters 2 through 4 explore the implications of quantum physics for organizational designs and practices for large, complex systems. Chapters 5 and 6 deal with the theory of self-organizing or dissipative structures. They introduce new ways of understanding disequilibrium and change, as well as the uses of disorder in creating new possibilities for evolutionary growth. Chaos theory is the  subject of chapter 7, which proposes a hypothesis to explain forces in organizations that create durable structure. The eighth chapter and the epilogue draw together various principles from the new science to offer a \"new\" scientific approach to management. Four figures, 10 photographs, an index, and a list of suggested readings are included. (Contains 78 references.) (LMI)",

        "description":"A wide variety of questions can be asked about the molecules that compose the physical reality around us and constitute biological life. Some of these questions are answered by the science called biology, others find their answer in chemistry, whereas the answers to the most fundamental questions are only to be found in the theories of physics. Inga Fischer-Hjalmars (born Fischer) belonged to the rare group of scientists who asked questions of all these kinds. Her life and career is a fascinating story of devotion, strive, and an unyielding curiosity about nature. As a young pharmacist, she had a central role in the development of the local anesthetic Xylocaine (also known as lidocaine), but the major part of her career was dedicated to explain the biological, chemical, and physical properties of molecules using the most fundamental principles available: quantum mechanics. Inga Fischer-Hjalmars was a pioneer in applying quantum mechanics to chemical problems, and she became the first female professor in theoretical physics in Sweden. Beside her scientific work, Inga Fischer-Hjalmars was a human rights activist dedicated to the freedom of oppositional and Jewish scientists in the Soviet Union. For this engagement, she was awarded with the New York Academy of Science's Human Rights of Scientists Award in 1990. (Contains 3 figures and 1 scheme.)",

        "author":["Gergely, John Robert"],
        "description":"Obtaining an accurate microscopic description of water structure and dynamics is of great interest to molecular biology researchers and in the physics and quantum chemistry simulation communities. This dissertation describes efforts to apply quantum Monte Carlo methods to this problem with the goal of making progress toward a fully \"ab initio\" quantum mechanical description of water that is accurate, efficient, and free of uncontrolled approximations. The projects described in this work are largely concerned with addressing three major challenges, described here.    We use Path Integral Monte Carlo to study proton zero point motion. We report on several technical aspects of implementing path integrals in Monte Carlo simulations of water: careful studies of convergence with respect to the number of discrete imaginary time slices; if pair product actions can improve convergence over the primitive approximation; handling the non-trivial geometry of the water molecule, including numerical evaluation of the exact density matrix for rotations of a rigid asymmetric rotor.    Questions remain about the ability of self consistent DFT-GGA calculations to accurately describe the electronic structure of water. Because Diffusion Monte Carlo (and other projector methods) accept wave functions that explicitly include correlations and improve on a trial wave function by projecting the overlap with the exact ground state, we are motivated to ask if QMC results are more accurate than DFT. We present a set of benchmark data from Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations on configurations of 32 water molecules at various temperatures, believed to be the first systematic investigation of bulk water using DMC.    Finally, and most generally, autocorrelation times for energies and structural properties are very long, on the order of thousands of Monte Carlo cycles or picoseconds of Molecular Dynamics integration. Thus a great deal of computational effort is required to generate statistically independent, well-converged data. This problem affects all water simulations, but the implications are most severe for \"ab initio\" methods, where the cost for a single simulation step is very high to begin with. We describe a number of approaches to address this challenge and their utility and outlook.    [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

        "description":"This report describes evaluations of two courses which were conducted, primarily through participant observation, in 1981. A general introduction looks at simulation in computer assisted learning (CAL) and at use of simulation CAL in the Open University science faculty. The first study discussed was based largely on a tutor's observations of student interaction with three genetics simulations during a week-long, summer school biology course. The simulations were EV299, a simple model of natural selection; OPERON, a more difficult program; and LNKOVR, which allows students to genetically map an &quot;electronic organism.&quot; Evaluation of the second course focused on the CAL experiences of students during a summer school quantum mechanics course that involved use of two simulations:  WELLS, which is used to find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of particles in potential wells by numerical integration of Schrodinger's equation, and MEASURE2, which allows students to describe what happens to eigenfunctions when various types of measurement are performed on a quantum harmonic oscillator. Study conclusions, a summary discussion, and six recommendations regarding CAL simulation in distance learning are included. (LMM)",

        "description":"The attractive photophysical properties of luminescent nanoparticles have prompted numerous studies on their synthesis and biological applications. Due to the complexity of components, sizes, morphologies, and strong light scattering of the nanoparticles the absorption spectrum alone is not enough for characterising and analysing the real absorption band of a nanoparticle product. Instead, the excitation spectrum is necessary for this purpose. To address the importance of the excitation spectrum in the utilisation of the photophysical properties of nanoparticles for cellular imaging, we compared the absorption and excitation spectra of a small organic molecule (rhodamine 6G) and commercially available nanoparticles (semiconductor quantum dots). Rhodamine 6G shows a good superimposition between its absorption and excitation spectra. However, the quantum dots do not, due to the presence of impurities and the polydispersity in nanoparticle size and shape. We demonstrated, by either spectrometer or cellular imaging, that excitation of the quantum dots at the maximum absorption peak will not result in the highest emission intensity. Instead, the best excitation wavelength for the nanoparticles can be revealed by the excitation spectrum. This has usually been overlooked by chemists and biologists.",

        "description":"STEM is about the integration of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. To teach STEM effectively, students need practical examples of subject integration. A good example is the use of an electron microscope in teaching physics and biology. An electron microscope is an instrument in which the operation depends on electromagnetism and quantum mechanics, in particular wave-particle duality. In teaching physics, an electron microscope can be used to measure the separation of repeated structures that give rise to interference phenomena. This paper describes the use a tabletop scanning electron microscope to teach physics and biology together through imaging butterfly wings. Students are able to identify structures with a spacing comparable to visible light on butterflies exhibiting structural colour and much larger spacing on wings without structural colour.",
