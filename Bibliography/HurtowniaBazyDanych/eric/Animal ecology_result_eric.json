          "Gjerris, Mickey"],
        "description":"This article focuses on the role of ethical perspectives such as deep ecology and animal rights in relation to environmental education, arguing that such perspectives are well-placed to reposition students as responsible planetary citizens. We focus on the linkage between non-consequentialism, animal rights, and deep ecology in an educational context and discuss the broader issue of ethics in education. Finally, we discuss how the inclusion of deep ecology and animal rights perspectives would improve current environmental education programs by deepening the respect for nonhumans and their inclusion in the ethical community.",

        "author":["Lloro-Bidart, Teresa"],
        "description":"This paper contributes to a nascent conversation in environmental education (EE) research by using ethnographic data and extant theory to develop a feminist posthumanist political ecology of education for theorizing human-animal relations/relationships. Specifically, I (1) engage feminist methodologies and theories; (2) give epistemological and theoretical attention to nonhuman animals; and (3) address the field of EE's minimal engagement with the interdisciplinary research agenda of political ecology. The paper begins with a literature review examining how feminist and/or posthumanist scholars have theorized human-animal (or human-nature) relations/relationships. Next, I outline the conceptual frameworks guiding the analyses of ethnographic data I collected at Long Beach, California's Aquarium of the Pacific and follow with a brief overview of the study. I conclude by outlining the major tenets of this article's conceptual framework, which contributes to a growing conversation in EE regarding human-animal relations/relationships and lays the groundwork for other political ecologies of education.",

        "description":"While the original objective of environmental education (EE) and education for sustainable development (ESD) acquired an awareness of the natural world and its current plight, animal welfare (AW), animal rights (AR), and deep ecology (DE) have often been absent within EE and ESD. AW and AR focus their attention on individual animals, while the DE perspective recognizes the intrinsic value of the environment. In this article, we shall discuss how the integration of these three approaches within EE/ESD can and should be improved, with particular reference to the ethical underpinnings of educational scholarship and practice. This article will argue that these three positions are well placed to enhance the democratic practices of EE/ESD through the adoption of an inclusive pluralism that embraces representation of non-human species and recognizes their interests.",

        "description":"Charles Darwin made numerous seminal contributions to the study of animal behavior over his long career. This essay places these contributions in the context of Darwin's life, showing his long-standing interest in psychological and behavioral issues encompassing all species, including humans. Ten areas are highlighted: natural history; communication; sexual selection and courtship; comparative cognition; emotion; instinct and behavioral development; inheritance of behavior; phylogeny of behavior; sociobiology and behavioral ecology; and applied animal behavior, animal welfare, and conservation. Several newer emphases that Darwin anticipated are briefly discussed. Darwin, while not always correct by current standards, crucially aided the process of firmly embedding psychological phenomena in a naturalistic scientific ethos.",

The problem-solving and critical thinking skills of students are improved through interactive activities involving oral and written communication, mathematics, creative arts, music, dance, and creative movement. This program is organized around the concepts of animal sizes and shapes, animal textures and patterns, animal colors, animal sounds, styles of animal locomotion and feeding, and animal survival needs. The material also provides a foundation for a more advanced understanding of ecology, biology, and conservation. The program components contained in this kit include: 6 student books, 48 student activity sheets, videotape,  audiotape cassettes, 6 classroom posters, family handbook, and teachers' manual. The six illustrated student books cover topics on anteaters and bats, spiny lizards and speckled racers, red pandas and golden toads, singing whales and trumpeting elephants, flying flycatchers and drilling sapsuckers, and the differences among living and non-living things.
