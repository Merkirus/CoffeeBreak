        "description":"The National Science Foundation (NSF) workshop on Optical Science and Engineering was organized to examine approaches NSF could use to identify opportunities in optical science, engineering, and education that meet both the mission of NSF and its broader national goals. The workshop participants identified opportunities where optical science and engineering research conducted by small interdisciplinary teams of investigators would significantly accelerate progress in areas of interest to the nation including the national information infrastructure, biology and medicine, chemistry and physics, materials processing and manufacturing, and education. This report contains: (1) an executive summary; (2) an introduction to the workshop and it's organization; (3) basic findings and  recommendations; (4) panel reports (panels include Information and Communication, Biology and Biomedical Engineering, Optical and Photonic Materials and Devices, Fundamental Optical Interactions, Optical Processing and Manufacturing, and Instrumentation and Sensing); and (5) NSF-wide initiative in optical science and engineering.

        "description":"A study examined the role of technicians in the fiber optics industry and determined those elements that should be included in a comprehensive curriculum to prepare fiber optics technicians for employment in the Texas labor market. First the current literature, including the ERIC database and equipment manufacturers' journals were reviewed. After the continuum of job tasks required for fiber optics technicians was identified, the occupational skills required of fiber optics technicians in the Texas labor market were analyzed through a users' survey. An advisory committee of representatives of business/industry technical educators, other educators, and Texas Education Agency personnel was formed. Data from the literature search, advisory committee input, and site visits to fiber  optics plants in Texas and a fiber optics conference were incorporated into recommendations concerning an appropriate training curriculum for fiber optics technicians and suggested methods for providing services to special needs students. Finally, all materials developed during the project were validated. (Appendixes to this report, which comprise more than half the document, include the industry needs survey, and equipment list for training stations, a list of fiber optics manufactures, quarterly project reports, a task analysis, and a list of advisory committee members.)

The diversity in the types and the functions of animal eyes is an excellent context in which to achieve this goal. There exists a range of subtopics in optics including pinhole, reflection, refraction, and superposition that can be discussed in the context of the animal eye. In addition to ordinary textbook optics questions, the use of context-based questions that model the real world may increase the students' motivation toward optics concepts and their understanding of them. In this article, different optical systems in animal eyes are discussed as a context to teach optics topics with context-based questions. (Contains 5 figures.)",
