All of the quantum computing resources described in this article are freely available, English-language web sites that fall into one of five categories: overviews, open access publications, research centers, companies, or news and blogs. The author includes sites that focus on the broader field of quantum information or the related topic of quantum cryptography, but she excludes sites that focus solely on quantum mechanics. Also, she excludes researchers' personal homepages, though it is worth mentioning that many quantum computing researchers maintain home pages that summarize their research interests and link to their papers. This webliography is the first article about quantum computing to appear in the library literature.",

        "description":"There is a quantum computing race among the tech giants Google, IBM, and Microsoft, including to a lesser extent Amazon and China's Alibaba. Governments, particularly America and China, are funding work in the area with the concern that quantum computers may soon crack current encryption methods, giving the country that gets there first a major advantage. There are currently about 100 universities worldwide with some activity in quantum computing. Considerable funding is also available and the 2019 U.S. National Quantum Initiative Act authorized $1.2 billion funding over the next 5-10 years. This paper shares the positive experience of Pace University in teaching quantum computing and encourages other schools to join us in this revolutionary step forward for computing. The paper discusses our experiences teaching a graduate-level quantum computing course, teaching the projects component of the course that develops problems to be solved on IBM's Q Experience quantum computing simulator, and teaching quantum computing modules in high schools.

        "description":"Contribution: In this study, an alternative educational approach for introducing quantum computing to a wider audience is highlighted. The proposed methodology considers quantum computing as a generalized probability theory rather than a field emanating from physics and utilizes quantum programming as an educational tool to reinforce the learning process. Background: Quantum computing is a topic mainly rooted in physics, and it has been gaining rapid popularity in recent years. A need for extending the educational reach to groups outside of physics has also been becoming a necessity. Intended Outcomes: This study aims to inform academics and organizations interested in introducing quantum computing to a diverse group of participants on an educational approach. It is intended that the proposed methodology would facilitate people from diverse backgrounds to enter the field. Application Design: The introductory quantum physics content is bypassed and the quantum computing concepts are introduced through linear algebra instead. Quantum programming tasks are prepared in line with the content. Pre/post-test design method and Likert scale satisfaction surveys are utilized to measure knowledge acquisition and to evaluate the perception of the learning process by the participants. Findings: Conducted pre/post-test design survey shows that there is a statistically significant increase in the basic knowledge levels of the participants on quantum computing concepts. Furthermore, no significant difference in the gain scores is observed between the participants from different STEM-related educational backgrounds. The majority of the participants were satisfied and provided positive feedback.",

        "description":"Quantum computing was once regarded as a mere theoretical possibility, but recent advances in engineering and materials science have brought practical quantum computers closer to reality. Currently, representatives from industry, academia, and governments across the world are working to build the educational structures needed to produce the quantum workforce of the future. Less attention has been paid to growing quantum computing capacity at the high school level. This article details work at The University of Texas at Austin to develop and pilot the first full-year high school quantum computing class. Over the course of two years, researchers and practitioners involved with the project learned several pedagogical and practical lessons that can be helpful for quantum computing course design and implementation at the secondary level. In particular, we find that the use of classical optics provides a clear and accessible avenue for representing quantum states and gate operators and facilitates both learning and the transfer of knowledge to other Science, Technology, and Engineering (STEM) skills. Furthermore, students found that exploring quantum optical phenomena prior to the introduction of mathematical models helped in the understanding and mastery of the material.",

        "description":"The article sets out to contribute to the educational challenge launched by the second quantum revolution. An approach to quantum computing has been outlined for secondary school students. The approach is shaped as a set of four principles that have been pointed out to design instructional materials to enhance the educational and cultural potential of quantum computing, beyond the technical aspects. In the paper, following a presentation of the design principles, we focus on an activity on quantum teleportation protocol. The activity is described in detail to show how the principles have been concretely implemented. A pilot study with a small sample of secondary school students has been carried out to evaluate the potential of the approach. The results, although preliminary, show that the approach appears to be promising in creating an inclusive and productive learning environment, in which students feel encouraged to search for personal ways to combine different levels of discourse (narrative, logical, mathematical, technical-experimental) and generate meaningful descriptions of the phenomenon.",

        "description":"Quantum technologies refer to any technology developed based on the principles of quantum physics. Quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum sensing are applications of such technologies, in which quantum mechanics underpins the key assumptions on their design and development. Quantum technologies promise revolutionary and disruptive innovations across a wide range of industries. Quantum computing will play an important role in artificial intelligence and will have an impact on every sector of the economy, from healthcare to national security. Currently, the workforce possessing a fundamental understanding of, and the technical skills needed for, quantum technologies is limited. This situation creates a significant challenge for educational system to address. There is a need to attract young people from diverse backgrounds to become engineers and scientists trained in quantum technologies. However, teaching a counterintuitive concept such as quantum cryptography might confuse young learners. Quantum cryptography is disconnected from physical realities that students expect to observe. Due to its nontrivial and counterintuitive aspects, it should be taught based on conceptual ideas rather than complex mathematical formulizations (Krijtenburg-Lewerissa, Brinkman, and van Joolingen, 2017). In this article, the authors demonstrate how to conduct an experiment with a quantum cryptography demonstration kit (Thorlabs 2017) and then provide a sample lesson plan about quantum key distribution (QKD), which illustrates the distribution of a key (or password) to encrypt or decrypt messages with the use of quantum properties based on the BB84 protocol developed by Bennett and Brassard (1984; 2014).",

Its main objective is to teach the unique concepts of quantum mechanics in a fun way. Quantum minesweeper demonstrates the effects of superposition, entanglement and their non-local characteristics. While in the classical minesweeper the goal of the game is to discover all the mines laid out on a board without triggering them, in the quantum version there are several classical boards in superposition. The goal is to know the exact quantum state, i.e. the precise layout of all the mines in all the superposed classical boards. The player can perform three types of measurement: a classical measurement that probabilistically collapses the superposition; a quantum interaction-free measurement that can detect a mine without triggering it; and an entanglement measurement that provides non-local information. The application of the concepts taught by quantum minesweeper to one-way quantum computing are also presented. (Contains 3 figures.)",

        "author":["Singh, Gurmukh"],
        "description":"The present article is primarily targeted for the advanced college/university undergraduate students of chemistry/physics education, computational physics/chemistry, and computer science. The most recent software system such as MS Visual Studio .NET version 2010 is employed to perform computer simulations for modeling Bohr's quantum theory of hydrogen (H) atom in class-setting of a virtual laboratory. The necessary computer algorithm is developed to compute discrete values of the orbit radius, and stationary energy levels of Bohr's H-atom. More than 2000 computer simulations are performed to investigate the quantum model behavior starting from the ground state of H-atom until we reached the energy continuum. One of the natural consequences of Bohr's model is that it could provide a perfect corroboration of the experimentally observed spectrum of H-atom with that empirically obtained from formulas derived by famous scientists of 19th and 20th centuries. Using old theory of classical electrodynamics, it was not possible to explain the observed line spectrum of H-atom. Bohr's quantum model of H-atom set the stage for the development of a modern branch of physics and chemistry in microscopic world, the so called quantum mechanics and very recently of a new computing technique known as quantum computing.

        "description":"Quantum physics is the basis for many technologies that are a fundamental part of our daily lives (e.g., lasers) or that may become so in the future (e.g., quantum cryptography and quantum computing). Because of this, quantum physics is now a central aspect of many countries' secondary school curricula. In this article, we present the design and structure of an online secondary school course for synchronous learning on the historical development of quantum physics and its modern applications. With this online course entitled &quot;Reading Club Quantum Physics: From the Beginnings to Modern Quantum Technologies,&quot; we want to provide teachers with an individually usable resource for reading parts of quantum physics pioneers' original publications together with their students. For this purpose, we have didactically prepared selected articles with publication dates from 1901 to 2019 and enriched them in this course (consisting of a total of seven chapters) with various work materials. Interested teachers can access our course, without charge, for their own and their students' use by sending an email to the corresponding author.",

        "description":"Quantum technology is an emerging field of physics and engineering and important applications are expected in quantum computing, quantum sensing, quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. Thus the need for education in this field is increasing, while still remaining challenging. While the need for basic education in quantum physics is accepted in many countries, the possibilities still are limited. Concerning fundamental topics such as the superposition principle and complementarity, on the one hand, a large variety of simulations and animations are available. However, single-photon experiments are still beyond reach for any school, due to costs and technical difficulties. A promising approach seems to be a combination of cheap, easy-to-use and modular experimental kits for school which allow for wave optical experiments, in combination with quantum optical simulations. In the present article, we focus on the modularity and accessibility of an experimental kit based on 3D-printed 'Optic Cubes', which allow for a large variety of experiments in high school.",

        "description":"After the passage of the U.S. National Quantum Initiative Act in December 2018, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) recently assembled an interagency working group and conducted a workshop titled &quot;Key Concepts for Future Quantum Information Science Learners&quot; that focused on identifying core concepts for future curricular and educator activities to help precollege students engage with quantum information science (QIS). Helping precollege students learn these key concepts in QIS is an effective approach to introducing them to the second quantum revolution and inspiring them to become future contributors in the growing field of quantum information science and technology as leaders in areas related to quantum computing, communication, and sensing. This paper is a call to precollege educators to contemplate including QIS concepts into their existing courses at appropriate levels and get involved in the development of curricular materials suitable for their students. Also, research shows that compare-and-contrast activities can provide an effective approach to helping students learn. Therefore, we illustrate a pedagogical approach that contrasts the classical and quantum concepts so that educators can adapt them for their students in their lesson plans to help them learn the differences between key concepts in quantum and classical contexts.",

        "description":"To promote students' value-based agency, responsible science and sustainability, science education must address how students think about their personal and collective futures. However, research has shown that young people find it difficult to fully relate to the future and its possibilities, and few studies have focused on the potential of science education to foster futures thinking and agency. We report on a project that further explored this potential by developing future-oriented science courses drawing on the field of futures studies. Phenomenographic analysis was used on interview data to see what changes upper-secondary school students saw in their futures perceptions and agentic orientations after attending a course which adapted futures thinking skills in the context of quantum computing and technological approaches to global problems. The results show students perceiving the future and technological development as more positive but also more unpredictable, seeing their possibilities for agency as clearer and more promising (especially by identifying with their peers or aspired career paths), and feeling a deeper connection to the otherwise vague idea of futures. Students also felt they had learned to question deterministic thinking and to think more creatively about their own lives as well as technological and non-technological solutions to global problems. Both quantum physics and futures thinking opened new perspectives on uncertainty and probabilistic thinking. Our results provide further validation for a future-oriented approach to science education, and highlight essential synergies between futures thinking skills, agency, and authentic socio-scientific issues in developing science education for the current age.",
