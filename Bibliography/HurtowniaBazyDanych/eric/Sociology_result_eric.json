        "author":["Turner, Jonathan H."],
        "description":"Michael Burawoy's call for a public sociology disciplined by professional and policy sociology, on the one side, and driven by critical sociology, on the other, exposes the ideological biases of sociology to publics. In so doing, public sociology will thwart non-ideological efforts for sociology to exert influence on broader publics and on political decision-makers. In order for sociology to be able to influence public opinion and the decisions of key players in the political and economic arenas, it will need to earn respect through a long evolutionary process of careful research and explanation without ideological fervor. To expose the ideological biases of sociology will thwart this evolutionary process. In contrast, sociology would be much better to develop an engineering mentality in addressing issues, problems, and concerns of publics in present-day societies.",

        "description":"The article explores the relationship between sociology and sociology of education in the United Kingdom (UK), with specific reference to the development of a sociology of higher education. Though the article is mainly concerned with the UK, the broader issues raised, about the status and location of the sociology of education in relation to sociology, who defines research excellence and research prestige and who collaborates with whom (and why) in social science research, are much more widely relevant. There are three main themes. The first concerns the recent history of sociology of education in the UK and its current location in education departments in higher education institutions. The second theme examines the factors that may have led to or are symptomatic of sociology of education's separation from sociology itself. The third theme is the prospect for the development of the sociology of higher education and its potential for collaborative activity with sociologists and other social scientists. In conclusion, it is argued that the sociology of higher education is well placed to collaborate with sociology and other social sciences, whether in research or in programmes for new academics and professional doctorates.

Even beyond that, service sociology is an imperative for communicating the value of our discipline to our students and other constituents.

I offer six recommendations for advancing a &quot;culture of service&quot; in sociology, concluding with the case for service sociology as socialization to advance the common good while building sociological literacy.",

        "description":"The status of the sociology of sport within the discipline of sociology is explored. Review of the subfield since 1971 indicates an increase in the number of publications and communication relating to sport sociology topics. It is hypothesized, however, that sport sociology will not in the near future receive equal acceptance within sociology with other substantive subfields. A 1976 random survey of members of the American Sociological Association to determine relative rank of subfields revealed that sport (including leisure and recreation) ranked 35th out of the 36 subfields listed. Further analysis indicated that members combined their belief that sport sociology has a marginal status in sociology with the conviction that it has the potential for interdisciplinary analysis.  Many researchers who develop an academic interest in sport have sport backgrounds, are oriented toward applied sociology, and are comparatively new to the field of sociology. Sport sociology will become more acceptable if researchers become change agents who gain support of opinion leaders within professional organizations and academic departments and if they are able to encourage addition of sport-related topics to the sociology curriculum. It is concluded that sport sociology will not achieve full maturity as a subfield until it attains an identity (specific research area and a group of sociologists who do research on the topic) and is defined by the larger field of sociology as a legitimate area of inquiry.

        "description":"A neglected part of the history of teaching sociology is the history of teaching high school sociology. The American Sociological Association's centennial in 2005 affords sociologists an opportunity to reflect on the teaching of sociology--anywhere and everywhere that it happens. In the spirit of contributing to the history of teaching sociology in the United States, this paper outlines the roughly 95-year history of the teaching of high school sociology. I rely upon published course descriptions written by high school sociology teachers and empirical studies conducted by academic sociologists. They demonstrate that past high school sociology courses have focused primarily on examining social problems and current events, and on promoting citizenship education. This remains the case today. I offer several reasons why the courses have looked as they have over the past 95 years, and conclude with four predictions about the future of teaching high school sociology.
