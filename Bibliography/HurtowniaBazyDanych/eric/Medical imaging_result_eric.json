        "description":"In 2008 a new clinical anatomy curriculum with integrated medical imaging component was introduced into the University of Sydney Medical Program. Medical imaging used for teaching the new curriculum included normal radiography, MRI, CT scans, and ultrasound imaging. These techniques were incorporated into teaching over the first two years of the program as a part of anatomy practical sessions, in addition to dedicated lectures and tutorials given by imaging specialists. Surveys were conducted between 2009 and 2012 to evaluate the student acceptance of the integration. Students were asked to rate individual activities as well as provide open-ended comments. The number of students who responded to the surveys varied from 40% to 98%. Over 90% of the respondents were satisfied with the overall quality of teaching in the anatomy units. In summary, 48% to 63% of the responding students thought that the specialist imaging lectures helped them learn effectively; 72% to 77% of students thought that the cross-sectional practical sessions helped them to better understand the imaging modalities of CT, MRI, and ultrasound; 76% to 80% of students considered hands-on ultrasound session to be useful in understanding the application of ultrasound in abdominal imaging. The results also revealed key similarities and differences in student perceptions of the new integrated curriculum for students with both a high and low prior exposure to anatomy. Further evaluation will aid in refining the integrated medical imaging program and providing its future direction.",

        "title":"Faculty Perceptions and Use of Social Media in the Medical Imaging Curriculum in the United States",
        "author":["DuBose, Cheryl"],
        "description":"Social media networks are a worldwide phenomenon encompassing multiple generations of faculty and students. As the World Wide Web has developed and grown, so has the ability of individuals to communicate across hundreds and thousands of miles via these social media networks. An exploratory survey of members in the Association of Educators in Imaging and Radiologic Sciences was completed and analyzed to determine faculty perceptions and use of social media in the medical imaging curriculum in the United States. Medical imaging faculty were asked if they own a personal social media account, a professional social media account, and if they use social media in the classroom. This study revealed that approximately 74 percent of faculty own a personal social media account, while approximately 46 percent own a professional (networking) social media account. Approximately 69 percent of medical imaging faculty indicated that they incorporate at least one type of social media in the classroom, with YouTube being the most popular social media platform used in all listed subject areas (Introduction, Lab, Procedures, Physics/Exposure, Pathology, Clinical Education, Patient Care, and Radiobiology). Faculty were given the opportunity to provide feedback on the perceived advantages and disadvantages of social media use in the medical imaging curriculum. While 31 percent of faculty believe that social networks take more time than they are worth, 67 percent believe that social media should be used to enhance learning in the medical imaging curriculum.

        "description":"Radiological imaging is gaining relevance in the acquisition of competencies in clinical anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perceptions of medical students on teaching/learning of imaging anatomy as an integrated part of anatomical education. A questionnaire was designed to evaluate the perceptions of second-year students participating in a clinical anatomy course over three consecutive academic years. A principal component analysis was used to evaluate the dimensionality of the questionnaire. The variables were summarized using frequencies, mean, median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, minimum, and maximum. The results demonstrated that students felt the teaching of imaging anatomy influenced learning in the clinical anatomy course (mean = 4.5, median = 5.0) and subsequent clinical courses (mean = 4.4, median = 4.0). Regarding the imaging techniques used in the demonstration of anatomical structures, computed tomography (median = 5.0) and magnetic resonance imaging (median = 5.0) were highly rated. Students suggested the use of additional support material (37.6 percent) and favored a more practical approach. In conclusion, the results of this work highlight the value of imaging anatomy in learning human anatomy. Students' comments pointed out a need to focus teaching/learning programs toward a more practical rather than theoretical approach as well as a need to provide a better fit between sectional anatomy and clinical cases using imaging anatomy. In order to provide an optimal learning environment to students, it also seems important to create improved media material as an additional resource tool. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)",

This project aimed to evaluate the impact of an innovative virtual reality (VR) learning environment on the development of technical proficiency by students. The study assessed the technical skills of first year medical imaging students. The learning experience by each student was either via traditional laboratory-based simulation or VR simulation, for two specified anatomical protocols. Following the learning experience, the students performed role-plays and were assessed on their technical proficiency. The type of learning environment, laboratory-based or VR simulation, was recorded for each radiographic procedure, as well as demographic data. Data demonstrated an improved total role-play skill score for those students trained using VR software simulation compared with the total role-play skills score traditional laboratory simulation. Demographic multivariable analysis demonstrated no statistically significant association of age, gender, gaming skills/activity with the outcome. The novel medical imaging VR simulation learning tool facilitated technical skill acquisition, equal to, or slightly better than traditional laboratory training. Ongoing data collection will evaluate the impact this VR software has on the undergraduate medical imaging student.",

        "author":["Grey, Michael L."],
        "description":"This study was conducted to determine if specialty areas are emerging in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) profession due to advancements made in the medical sciences, imaging technology, and clinical applications used in MRI that would require new developments in education/training programs and national registry examinations.    In this exploratory study, statistical analysis incorporated the use of factor analysis and chi square. Factor analysis was used to group tasks performed by MRI technologists into factors to better identify emerging specialty areas within the MRI profession. Chi square was used to analyze the association between the tasks performed in (a) the employment setting, and (b) hospital size.    Factor analysis identified four meaningful factors. The four named factors were: (a) Routine Imaging non-Central Nervous System Imaging; (b) Advanced Imaging; (c) Routine Imaging with Central Nervous System Imaging; and (d) Musculoskeletal and Spine Imaging. From the four named factors, three emerging specialty areas were identified: (a) central nervous system imaging; (b) vascular/cardiovascular imaging; and (c) musculoskeletal imaging.    Chi square analysis identified 47 of the 78 tasks as being significant when finding an association between the employment setting and the frequency of tasks performed. Cramer's V was used to measure the strength of their association. The more complicated the procedure the more likely this procedure is performed in either a university or private hospital. Further, chi square analysis identified 42 of the 78 tasks as being significant when finding the association between the hospital size and the frequency of tasks performed. Gamma was used to measure the strength of their association. This means the larger the hospital, the more frequent the tasks were performed.

        "title":"The Success of African American Medical Imaging Students: A Transformative Study of Student Engagement",
        "author":["Herrmann, Tracy L."],
        "description":"African American medical imaging students may face unique challenges due to racial differences in higher education experiences (Fries-Britt &amp; Turner, 2001; Harper, 2007; Haysbert &amp; Williams, 2007; Quaye, Griffin, &amp; Museus, 2015) and racial inequities in healthcare (Lang &amp; Bird, 2015; Molina, Kim, Berrios, &amp; Calhoun, 2015; Ross et al., 2012) that influence their success. Student engagement--the manner in which students connect with the educational environment (Felton, Gardner, Schroeder, Lambert, &amp; Barefoot, 2016; Kuh, et al., 2005a; Kuh, 2008; Kezar &amp; Kinzie, 2006)--is one approach toward impacting student success. This study draws from the healthcare and education literature to examine African American student and alumni perspectives of their experiences of student engagement practices as well as to highlight their recommendations for future actions necessary to support student success. The two phases of this transformative mixed methods study design included a student and alumni survey followed by a group level assessment (GLA) alumni forum--a multi-step qualitative participatory process (Vaughn &amp; Lohmueller, 2014). Researcher and participant integration of the quantitative and qualitative data embodies the transformative nature of the study by focusing on positive change recommendations for educator and medical imaging community practices. In the quantitative phase, survey respondents report high levels of student engagement with faculty in the classroom. Alternatively, data indicate a large deficit in student engagement practices outside of class with few same race mentoring and networking opportunities. The qualitative survey data show participants' experiences corroborated the tenets of critical race theory as evidenced by their descriptions of isolation and racial stereotyping. During the qualitative phase of the study, African American alumni GLA participants integrated the quantitative and qualitative data to determine priorities for student engagement practices such as embracing the whole student and sharing positive messages about medical imaging careers. Participants further provided perspectives of their concerns and fears impacted by race in alignment with critical race theory and recommended improvements in admissions and recruitment practices for students of color. Further researcher integration of the data provided best practice recommendations for implementation by faculty, programs, and clinical education sites, including improved communication and creation of more inclusive educational environments. In total, these findings suggest that many opportunities exist for improving the experience of African American students in medical imaging programs. This study provides a unique set of action priorities for implementation by medical imaging programs to support the success of African American medical imaging students in a highly segregated geographic region. The research builds upon prior research suggesting that student success is a shared responsibility (Kuh et al., 2005b) impacted by race (Berger, Ramirez, &amp; Lyons, 2012; Musu-Gillette et al., 2016; Harper, 2007; Quaye et al., 2015). The transformative nature of the study identifies student engagement practice improvements needed to support African American medical imaging students and calls attention to the importance of the inclusion of members of the African American medical imaging community in the planning and implementation process.

        "description":"The utility of three-dimensional (3D) printed models for medical education in complex congenital heart disease (CHD) is sparse and limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of 3D printed models for medical education in criss-cross hearts covering a wide range of participants with different levels of knowledge and experience, from medical students, clinical fellows up to senior medical personnel. Study participants were enrolled from four dedicated imaging workshops developed between 2016 and 2019. The study design was a non-randomized cross-over study to evaluate 127 participants' level of understanding of the criss-cross heart anatomy. This was evaluated using the scores obtained following teaching with conventional images (echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging) versus a 3D printed model learning approach. A significant improvement in anatomical knowledge of criss-cross heart anatomy was observed when comparing conventional imaging test scores to 3D printed model tests [76.9% (61.5%-87.8%) vs. 84.6% (76.9%-96.2%), P &lt; 0.001]. The increase in the questionnaire marks was statistically significant across all academic groups (consultants in pediatric cardiology, fellows in pediatric cardiology, and medical students). Ninety-four percent (120) and 95.2% (121) of the participants agreed or strongly agreed, respectively, that 3D models helped them to better understand the medical images. Participants scored their overall satisfaction with the 3D printed models as 9.1 out of 10 points. In complex CHD such as criss-cross hearts, 3D printed replicas improve the understanding of cardiovascular anatomy. They enhanced the teaching experience especially when approaching medical students.",

The multidisciplinary nature and rapid advancement of imaging sciences requires imaging education to begin early in the biology curriculum. Guided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap initiatives, we incorporated a nanoimaging, molecular imaging, and medical imaging teaching unit into three 1-h class periods of an introductory course on ways of knowing biology. Activities were derived from NIH Roadmap initiatives in nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, and nuclear medicine. The course materials we describe contributed positively to student learning gains in quantifying and interpreting images, in characterizing imaging methods that provide ways of knowing biological structure and function, and in understanding scale in biology and imaging. The NIH Roadmap provides a useful context to educate students about the multidisciplinary imaging continuum. (Contains 3 tables and 4 figures.)",

        "description":"A wide variety of medical imaging techniques pervade modern medicine, and the changing portability and performance of tools like ultrasound imaging have brought these medical imaging techniques into the everyday practice of many specialties outside of radiology. However, proper interpretation of ultrasonographic and computed tomographic images requires the practitioner to not only hone certain technical skills, but to command an excellent knowledge of sectional anatomy and an understanding of the pathophysiology of the examined areas as well. Yet throughout many medical curricula there is often a large gap between traditional anatomy coursework and clinical training in imaging techniques. The authors present a radiological anatomy course developed to teach sectional anatomy with particular emphasis on ultrasonography and computed tomography, while incorporating elements of medical simulation. To assess students' overall opinions about the course and to examine its impact on their self-perceived improvement in their knowledge of radiological anatomy, anonymous evaluation questionnaires were provided to the students. The questionnaires were prepared using standard survey methods. A five-point Likert scale was applied to evaluate agreement with statements regarding the learning experience. The majority of students considered the course very useful and beneficial in terms of improving three-dimensional and cross-sectional knowledge of anatomy, as well as for developing practical skills in ultrasonography and computed tomography. The authors found that a small-group, hands-on teaching model in radiological anatomy was perceived as useful both by the students and the clinical teachers involved in their clinical education. In addition, the model was introduced using relatively few resources and only two faculty members.",
