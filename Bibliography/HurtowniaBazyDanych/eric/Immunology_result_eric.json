        "description":"Interest and motivation significantly influence achievement; however, interest in immunology remains to be determined. Using a structured questionnaire, the current study assessed for the first time interest in immunology among biomedical graduate students in Ghana after a one-week introduction to immunology course. Our results revealed that approximately 80% of study participants expressed an interest in immunology. In addition, we showed that interest in immunology was independent of age and gender of the study participants. More interestingly, we observed that interest in immunology was primarily influenced by career choice. The findings from the present study have implications on immunology education and calls for investment in building capacity in immunology especially in developing countries.",

        "description":"As immunology continues to evolve, many educational methods have found difficulty in conveying the degree of complexity inherent in its basic principles. Today, the teaching-learning process in such areas has been improved with tools such as educational software. This article introduces &quot;Virtual Immunology,&quot; a software program available free of charge in Portuguese and English, which can be used by teachers and students in physiology, immunology, and cellular biology classes. We discuss the development of the initial two modules: &quot;Organs and Lymphoid Tissues&quot; and &quot;Inflammation&quot; and the use of interactive activities to provide microscopic and macroscopic understanding in immunology. Students, both graduate and undergraduate, were questioned along with university level professors about the quality of the software and intuitiveness of use, facility of navigation, and aesthetic organization using a Likert scale. An overwhelmingly satisfactory result was obtained with both students and immunology teachers. Programs such as &quot;Virtual Immunology&quot; are offering more interactive, multimedia approaches to complex scientific principles that increase student motivation, interest, and comprehension.",

Students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics programs is essential for better academic performances and outcomes in a University of Science Technology. To this end, we assessed the factors that influence students' interest in immunology among a group of 32 graduate students in a tertiary institution in Ghana. The study was conducted using quantitative instruments (questionnaires) after which principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reveal the underlying factors affecting students' interest in the course. In all, six components were found including students' perception, instructor quality, student's interest/motivation, teaching methods, teaching materials and teaching facilities. Students' interest in immunology correlated negatively but significantly with perception; however, interest correlated positively with teaching methods (p &lt; 0.001). Our study is the first to investigate the factors that influence students' interest in immunology in Ghana and supports the growing functionality of PCA approach for dimension reduction and exploratory factor analysis.",

        "description":"Immunology is a knowledge area of paramount importance in life sciences and health care professional education with diverse applications, as well as for a general public understanding of issues related to vaccination. However, many concepts are complex and difficult to understand based only on conventional classes or static images. The use of tools, such as educational software, may enhance the learning of dynamic molecular phenomena that occur in our bodies. Virtual Immunology is a software that aims to facilitate the learning of certain complex immunology concepts. Herein, we present the &quot;Antigen-antibody interactions&quot; module that was used and evaluated by 127 students and 3 teachers from medical schools from 2 universities, 1 public and 1 private, both in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The pretest/posttest research design was used to assess student learning in a randomized sample. To evaluate user perceptions concerning software quality, 14 statements were analyzed using a Likert scale. Results indicate suitable evaluations from both students and teachers concerning the &quot;Antigen-antibody module&quot; as an auxiliary tool in immunology teaching. The software was well rated as an educational resource since it allows dynamically viewing immunological phenomena. In addition, its ease of use and immunological process visualization were the best-evaluated parameters by the students, who recommended this software module as an auxiliary learning tool. The use of the evaluated software may motivate students and aid in the understanding of immunology-related concepts, becoming a complementary tool that may enhance the teaching-learning process.",

The aim of this investigation is to assess students' perceptions to the APP-based flipped classroom (APP-FC) teaching model in an immunology course. The data of this study were collected from second-year medical students (n = 92) at Lanzhou University. One class (n = 50), as a control group, was offered lecture-based learning (LBL), while the other class (n = 42), as the APP-FC group, was given lecture-based instruction and the APP-FC teaching model during September-November 2017. Afterward, the perceptions of students on APP-FC teaching model were evaluated using questionnaires. Students responded that APP-FC improves their motivation (83%) and interest in learning immunology (81%), as well as their self-directed learning skills (81%). Compared to the traditional lecture-based instruction, the APP-FC noticeably improved students' motivation in learning (P = 0.011), self-directed learn skills (P = 0.001), memory abilities (P = 0.009), and problem-solving abilities (P = 0.010). Most medical students' scores (60%) in the final examination were more than 80 points after implementing an APP-FC model as compared to the control group (40%). The majority of students (70%) preferred the APP-FC teaching approach over traditional lecture-based pedagogy. The implementation of the APP-FC teaching model could improve students' learning motivation, self-directed learn skills, and problem-solving abilities, which is a preferable teaching model for medical immunology courses in China.",

Students performed data-collection through the execution of an &quot;in vitro&quot; assay. We analyzed how students represent data and use them to support their claims in their written constructs. To clarify which are the productive epistemologies in students' reports, we developed a framework for epistemic practice analysis. Our findings point to a pattern of several epistemic practice categories in their written text, mostly related to the particular contingences of data analysis, rather than to theoretical concepts. In addition, we observed that students performed literary inscriptions to represent their data; however, they tended not to cite all data obtained in their written texts. These results suggest that immunology education strategies should provide students with approaches that explore the role Epistemology of data representation in the scientific text rhetoric.",

        "description":"Immunology is gaining prominence both in the media as well as on the Advanced Placement (AP) exam in Biology. One of the challenges of teaching modern biological topics such as immunology and biochemistry in the high-school setting is the increased reliance on expensive technology in the research world. To begin to bridge this widening gap, we devised an experiment using a novel macroscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that is suitable for AP-level high-school biology classrooms as well as entry-level collegiate laboratories. This novel method does not require a plate reader for data analysis, but instead relies on more common and inexpensive equipment such as a clinical test tube centrifuge and a simple test tube spectrophotometer. The experimental plan focuses on students measuring antibody concentrations in \"unknown\" samples and includes the collection and analysis of a standard curve using reagents prepared by the instructor. Students will be introduced to enzyme action, quantitative laboratory technique, antibodies, and the immune system, with the overall goal being to explore and highlight the inherent connections within the fields of biochemistry and immunology.

        "description":"The following project aimed at promoting integrated and long-lasting learning is described for an Immunology course, but it may be adapted to other disciplines. Students were asked to develop and carry out a research project to examine the relationship between immune function and stress. The experiments were required to include the assessment of salivary cortisol and salivary IgA (sIgA) with enzyme immunoassays. All other aspects of the experiments were developed by student groups with appropriate guidance from the instructor. Data are presented for one group project that assessed the effect of music on cortisol and sIgA. Overall levels of sIgA and cortisol were consistent with reported values. Students found a significant decrease in cortisol over time. Additionally, there was a trend that supported the overall student hypothesis regarding the effect of stress and immune function. Compared with the same Immunology course that included an instructor-designed experiment using enzyme immunoassays for cortisol and sIgA, several assessments (e.g., final grades and comments on student evaluations) show that overall learning seemed to be much better in the course with the student-directed research project.

In this article we explore the motif of &quot;border immunology' with reference to new history, a mobile paradigm of history teaching, and Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot history textbooks as types of local borders that have been impermeable to new history. The overall argument we explore here is that ethnonational forms of collective identities that are imagined to be constitutive of textbook borders account for immunity to mobility and change.",

        "description":"Over the last few decades, there has been a shift in the classroom from lecture-based to active learning settings with the argument that students retain more information when they are involved in the learning process. This correlation is even stronger when the active learning setting incorporates a real-world or personal connection. Using active learning activities that develop students' ability to comprehend primary scientific literature is particularly important in the field of immunology, due to the rapid expansion of information in the field, which has been further accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By nature, immunology is interdisciplinary, requiring an integrated knowledge of concepts from several scientific disciplines to understand complex immune processes. Engaging undergraduate students through the use of primary literature can improve scientific literacy, develop critical thinking, and enhance understanding of complex topics. To explore this, we utilized a group learning activity in an introductory immunology course that incorporated both a coronavirus-related review and COVID-19 clinical research article. We found that this learning activity significantly enhanced student confidence in key scientific literacy skills: reading scientific literature, clearly explaining relevant points, and describing conclusions generated from the data. Moreover, all students reported that they enjoyed the activity and that it helped them understand more about the current COVID-19 pandemic in the context of the immune response.",
