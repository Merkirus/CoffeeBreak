        "description":"A proposal for current trends in Aerospace Engineering Education on Taiwan has been drawn from the suggestions made after a national conference of &quot;Workshop on Aerospace Engineering Education Reform.&quot; This workshop was held in January 18-20, 1998, at the Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C. The workshop was held to review the current aerospace engineering education, both in undergraduate and graduate programs, and to make suggestions on course planning, courseware materials and modern topics so that the aerospace graduates are able to work in the high technology, challenging real world. At the closure of this conference, some suggestions were proposed in detail on current trends of four aerospace engineering education  programs on Taiwan, both for undergraduate as well as graduate studies. In general, undergraduate courses stress fundamentals and physical appreciation, whereas the graduate education is taught to contribute to the advancement of technology. International cooperation and technology transfer under mutual interest are recognized as the best ways to achieve high technologies. It is expected that the suggestions on current trends of Aerospace Engineering Education on Taiwan would work as a good reference for other countries if they also choose aerospace technology as one of the major industries in the challenging 21st century.

Students&apos; appreciation and application of design processes underpinned the problem-solving activities throughout their STEM program.

The second chapter describes the work typically performed by aerospace scientists, engineers and technicians. It includes the qualifications needed for these extremely specialized and diverse careers, the preparation and training associated with them, as well as predicted future trends in the field. The third chapter offers suggestions for high school students as they begin to plan for future  aerospace careers. Sources of career guidance information, high school subjects emphasized, and the selection of an appropriate college are discussed. The fourth chapter addresses the issue of developing study skills necessary for academic success. Time management procedures and strategies for implementing study skills techniques are suggested. The fifth section identifies some factors which influence career decisions. The final chapter discusses the aerospace challenge in shaping the future.
