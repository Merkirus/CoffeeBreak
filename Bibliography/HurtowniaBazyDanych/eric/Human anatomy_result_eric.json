        "description":"Much research has shown the benefits of additional anatomical learning and dissection beyond the first year of medical school human gross anatomy, all the way through postgraduate medical training. We have developed an interactive method for teaching eye and orbit anatomy to medical students in their ophthalmology rotation at Duke University School of Medicine. We provide review lectures on the detailed anatomy of the adult human eye and orbit as well as the developmental anatomy of the eye. These lectures are followed by a demonstration of the anatomy of the orbit using conventional frontal and superior exposures on a prosected human cadaver. The anatomy is projected onto a large LCD screen using a mounted overhead camera. Following a brief lecture on clinically relevant anatomy, each student then dissects a fresh porcine (pig) eye under low magnification using a dissecting microscope. These dissections serve to identify structures extrinsic to the eyeball, including extraocular muscle attachments, small vessels, optic nerve stalk, and fascial sheath of the eyeball (Tenon's fascia). Dissection then shifts to the internal anatomy of the eyeball. The size and anatomy of the porcine eye is comparable with that of the human and the dissection provides students with a valuable hands-on learning opportunity that is otherwise not available in embalmed human cadavers. Students and clinical faculty feedback reveal high levels of satisfaction with the presentation of anatomy and its scheduling early during the ophthalmology clerkship.

        "description":"We incorporated clay modeling into gross anatomy and neuro-anatomy courses to help students understand cross-sectional anatomy. By making clay models, cutting them and comparing cut surfaces to CT and MR images, students learned how cross-sectional two-dimensional images were created from three-dimensional structure of human organs. Most students in a clay modeling group responded positively to this approach, and their average score on CT examination was higher than that of a group that did not use clay models. Clay modeling appears to be a useful supplement to conventional anatomy or radiologic anatomy education. It can be applied to any part of human body, and its effectiveness will be greater when a more complicated understanding of cross-sectional anatomy is required. (Contains 1 table and 4 figures.)",

        "author":["Rosario, Martin G."],
        "description":"As a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, converting traditional face-to-face instructional methods into online courses have been a challenge. Online teaching offers limited options and means for explaining human anatomy, inflicting significant hardships in perceiving the depth and organization of anatomy among graduate students. This article addresses the integration of a 3-D anatomy application into an online graduate anatomy course among ninety-five Occupational Therapy scholars with various academic backgrounds enrolled via an online survey. Complete 3-D Anatomy app was used as a reinforcement to teaching human anatomy within the format of online Zoom sessions. Students' test scores and survey responses were employed to gather the information presented in this review. Results showed that all scholars believed the anatomy app was a useful supplement to the understanding of human anatomy, while the app-user pupils earned a greater percentage of passing grades in comparison to their peers in the non-app user group. Adopting the 3-D anatomy app as a supplemental tool during online anatomy courses to enhance students' understanding of human anatomy was successful. For prospective anatomy courses, we plan to integrate and explore the influences of an individual tablet/iPad with 3-D apps for each student for distinct insights on the impact of maneuvering and examining anatomical structures.",

        "author":["Rosario, Martín G."],
        "description":"While cadaver dissection and prosection are deemed quintessential methods for studying anatomy, these methods are attenuated by the flat, 2-D structures incorporated into didactic segments of the anatomy courses that minimize students' ability to comprehend anatomy, leading to constraints in the teaching and learning experience. Several tools, such as 3-D virtual anatomy apps and anatomical models, enhance teaching and students' understanding of gross human anatomy. The Anatomage, a virtual anatomy dissection table (VDT), is a compelling technological development with dissection capabilities and a prosection of the human body and its segments. This study intends to explore incorporating a VDT into a physical therapy anatomy course as an enhanced anatomical learning technique. The methods encompass the inclusion of the VDT as an extra dissection table within the cadaver lab setting. Each group of scholars was required to locate the anatomical configurations and dissections assigned to the topic on the VDT. The anatomy course included four examinations covering the entire human body. The results suggest advancements in knowledge retention following the incorporation of VDT in the cadaver dissection portion of the course. Therefore, we ascertained that the VDT is an exemplary tool to adopt in anatomy courses to aid in the comprehension of complex anatomical structures. Integrating VDT is paramount to the assimilation and application of human anatomy in students' future health careers.",

        "description":"Introductory anatomy and physiology courses are either taught as discipline-specific courses (human anatomy and human physiology) or integrated sequences [combined human anatomy and physiology (A&amp;P I and A&amp;P II)]. This variation suggests there is no agreed upon pedagogical standard for teaching introductory anatomy and physiology. We surveyed undergraduate students enrolled in human anatomy, human physiology, A&amp;P I, and A&amp;P II to determine their course approach preference, either discipline-specific or an integrated A&amp;P sequence, and the underlying reasons for their preferences. The literature suggests that understanding students' preferred learning environment influences learner satisfaction, level of achievement, and socioemotional adjustment in the classroom. Our qualitative analysis revealed students prefer an integrated A&amp;P course approach to a discipline-specific sequence with &quot;building on prior knowledge,&quot; &quot;easier,&quot; and &quot;increased understanding&quot; emerging as the top reasons for their preferences.

        "description":"Understanding basic human anatomy can be beneficial for all students, regardless of when, or if, they will later undertake a formal course in the subject. For students who are preparing to undertake a formal anatomy course, educational comics on basic anatomy can serve as a concise and approachable review of the material. For other students, these comics can serve as a helpful and fun introduction to the human body. The objective of the comics in this study was to promote an understanding of fundamental human anatomy through self-learning among students. Based on the authors' previous teaching experience, these anatomy comics were produced in a simple, direct style. The comics were titled after the two main characters, &quot;Anna&quot; (a girl) and &quot;Tommy&quot; (a boy). These comics were then presented to groups of elementary school students, high school students, premedical students, and medical students to assess the comics' ability to enhance student interest and comprehension of basic anatomy. Quiz scores among high school students and premedical students were significantly higher among participants who read the educational comics, indicating a deeper comprehension of the subject. Among medical students, close reading of the comics was associated with improved course grades. These educational anatomy comics may be helpful tools to enrich a broad spectrum of different students in learning basic human anatomy.",

        "description":"A human anatomy teacher-scholar is a scholar whose area of expertise includes content knowledge of the anatomical sciences (gross anatomy, histology, embryology, and/or neuroanatomy) and whose research interests and focus are centered in medical educational outcomes. The projects described in this dissertation represent endeavors I engaged in to become a human anatomy teacher-scholar. These projects included: (1) prospectively testing a hypothesis, and performing outcomes assessment in a field for which little data (theory) exist (dissection guide educational research project), (2) creating innovative course content that bridged disciplines (cadaver autopsy project), and (3) composing original teaching material for a specific audience (human anatomy laboratory manual).    The training of a human anatomy teacher-scholar emphasizes knowledge acquisition in both the basic sciences (particularly gross anatomy) and in educational outcomes research methodology and theory. Therefore, human anatomy teacher-scholars are positioned to create innovative course content and materials and assess the innovations to guide future efforts. These are important skills for faculty members involved in the education of medical students in the U.S. as the medical education system in the U.S. continues to evolve.

        "description":"There is a widely variable breadth of coverage of skeletal muscle content across both undergraduate human anatomy and undergraduate anatomy and physiology (A&amp;P) courses. In response to the need for a more global understanding of the content taught in undergraduate anatomy courses, we developed an online survey (administered through Qualtrics) where both human anatomy and A&amp;P faculty could report skeletal muscle coverage in their courses. The survey also collected comparative demographic institutional data such as the type of institution (community college vs. 4 year), course format, and geographic location of the undergraduate institution. Skeletal muscles surveyed included those listed and described in a typical undergraduate human anatomy text (McKinley MP, O'Loughlin VD, Pennefather O. &quot;Human Anatomy&quot; (5th ed.), 2017, p. 960). The data indicated some interesting instructional trends regarding muscular system coverage. First, both the &quot;identification&quot; and &quot;action&quot; of specific muscles are taught at a higher frequency than the teaching of either &quot;attachments or innervation.&quot; Innervation of specific skeletal muscles is the least taught concept. In each body region, certain muscles were taught with higher frequency than others. This research shows there is a global trend in teaching identification of specific skeletal muscles within each body region and often this is accompanied by teaching actions of said muscles. These general instructional trends may increase our understanding of the anatomical and physiological education our undergraduate students are receiving and will lead to further critical conversations about content development and curriculum.",

        "author":["Kuyatt, Brian Lee"],
        "description":"Human anatomy courses, with laboratory, are curricular requirements in graduate medical, undergraduate nursing, and all allied health science programs. Anatomy laboratory courses engage students in hands-on activities, including human cadaver or mammalian dissection, supported by photos from textbooks, detailed plastic models or human anatomical specimens, to understand three-dimensional (3D) spatial relationships. To increase 3D learning, instructors use sophisticated software, such as Practice Anatomy Laboratory or PAL(TM) 2.0 (Pearson Education, 2011), utilizing human cadaver photos, 3D images, and interactive assessments to master terminology and spatial anatomy. However, as anatomy instructional software has improved, measuring learning effectiveness from these programs has lagged behind. This study evaluates student human anatomical learning following use of the PAL(TM) 2.0 software in community college traditional face-to-face and hybrid online class anatomy laboratory classes. Learning effectiveness is measured using a valid and reliable quantitative instrument called the CAP (cognitive, affective, psychomotor) Perceived Learning Scale and an associated Attitudinal Survey. Study results indicate that students can effectively learn human anatomical spatial relationships with digital software tools, specifically using the PAL(TM) 2.0 software. This study determined that student-perceived learning was significantly greater in the online class environment and was specifically related to psychomotor learning--the learning related to science. The findings of this study have implications for future educational practice in the use of advanced digital software for learning in both traditional and distance education courses as instructors seek to find better methods to assist their students in developing skills in learning human anatomy.

        "description":"The use of cadavers to teach anatomy is well established, but limitations with this approach have led to the introduction of alternative teaching methods. One such method is the use of three-dimensional virtual reality computer models. An interactive, three-dimensional computer model of human forearm anterior compartment musculoskeletal anatomy was produced using the open source 3D imaging program &quot;Blender.&quot; The aim was to evaluate the use of 3D virtual reality when compared with traditional anatomy teaching methods. Three groups were identified from the University of Manchester second year Human Anatomy Research Skills Module class: a &quot;control&quot; group (no prior knowledge of forearm anatomy), a &quot;traditional methods&quot; group (taught using dissection and textbooks), and a &quot;model&quot; group (taught solely using e-resource). The groups were assessed on anatomy of the forearm by a ten question practical examination. ANOVA analysis showed the model group mean test score to be significantly higher than the control group (mean 7.25 vs. 1.46, P less than 0.001) and not significantly different to the traditional methods group (mean 6.87, P greater than 0.5). Feedback from all users of the e-resource was positive. Virtual reality anatomy learning can be used to compliment traditional teaching methods effectively. (Contains 3 figures.)",

        "author":["Wright, Shirley J."],
        "description":"Several programs in health professional education require or are considering requiring upper-level human anatomy as prerequisite for their applicants. Undergraduate students are confronted with few institutions offering such a course, in part because of the expense and logistical issues associated with a cadaver-based human anatomy course. This study describes the development of and student reactions to an upper-level human anatomy laboratory course for undergraduate students that used a regional approach and contemporary, alternative teaching methods to a cadaver-based course. The alternative pedagogy to deliver the curriculum included use of commercially available, three-dimensional anatomical virtual dissection software, anatomical models coupled with a learning management system to offer Web-based learning, and a new laboratory manual with collaborative exercises designed to develop the student's anatomical skills and collaborative team skills. A Likert-scale survey with open-ended questions was used to ascertain student perceptions of the course and its various aspects. Students perceived that the noncadaver-based, upper-level human anatomy course with an engaging, regional approach is highly valuable in their learning of anatomy.",

        "description":"Integrating lecture and laboratory material from a human anatomy course can be difficult for undergraduate students. This study sought to examine the effectiveness of yoga poses as experiential learning techniques for the musculoskeletal system. Yoga Anatomy (YA) workshop instructors discussed muscle names, locations, and functions as they applied to specific yoga poses using a PowerPoint presentation and posture demonstrations. Students then actively participated in each yoga pose as instructors reinforced the anatomy. YA participants not only scored higher on both pre- and post-tests than non-participants, they also showed positive trends in knowledge gain from pre-test to post-test. Although several factors, including a self-selection bias, may have influenced the study, the results suggest that yoga may be an effective form of experiential learning for human anatomy students.",

This assignment can be anything from an essay to a research paper on the literature, focusing on a faculty-approved topic of interest to the student. As educators who teach Human Anatomy and Physiology at an urban community college, the authors believe it is important to provide students with an assignment that challenges not only their knowledge of the subject, but also their imaginations. To achieve this goal, they assign Design Projects in Human Anatomy and Physiology. In this article, the authors describe these design projects, which not only capture students' interest, but also challenge them to use creative thinking skills.
