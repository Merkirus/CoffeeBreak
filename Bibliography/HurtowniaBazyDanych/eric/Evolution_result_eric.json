        "description":"Although many scientists agree that evolution does not make claims about God/god(s), students might assume that evolution is atheistic, and this may lead to lower evolution acceptance. In study 1, we surveyed 1081 college biology students at one university about their religiosity and evolution acceptance and asked what religious ideas someone would have to reject if that person were to accept evolution. Approximately half of students wrote that a person cannot believe in God/religion and accept evolution, indicating that these students may have atheistic perceptions of evolution. Religiosity was not related to whether a student wrote that evolution is atheistic, but writing that evolution is atheistic was associated with lower evolution acceptance among the more religious students. In study 2, we collected data from 1898 students in eight states in the United States using a closed-ended survey. We found that 56.5% of students perceived that evolution is atheistic even when they were given the option to choose an agnostic perception of evolution. Further, among the most religious students, those who thought evolution is atheistic were less accepting of evolution, less comfortable learning evolution, and perceived greater conflict between their personal religious beliefs and evolution than those who thought evolution is agnostic.",

        "description":"Evolution is controversial among students and religiosity, religious affiliation, understanding of evolution, and demographics are predictors of evolution acceptance. However, quantitative research has not explored the unique impact of student perceived conflict between their religion and evolution as a major factor influencing evolution acceptance. We developed an instrument with validity evidence called &quot;Perceived Conflict between Evolution and Religion&quot; (PCoRE). Using this measure, we find that, among students in 26 biology courses in 11 states, adding student perceived conflict between their religion and evolution to linear mixed models more than doubled the capacity of the models to predict evolution acceptance compared with models that only included religiosity, religious affiliation, understanding of evolution, and demographics. Student perceived conflict between evolution and their religion was the strongest predictor of evolution acceptance among all variables and mediated the impact of religiosity on evolution acceptance. These results build upon prior literature that suggests that reducing perceived conflict between students' religious beliefs and evolution can help raise evolution acceptance levels. Further, these results indicate that including measures of perceived conflict between religion and evolution in evolution acceptance studies in the future is important.",

The study was designed as a qualitative phenomenological study. Data were obtained from document analyses from self-report questionnaires. Ten descriptive categories were outlined, namely &quot;evolution is related to change and development,&quot; &quot;evolution is related to the diversity of life,&quot; &quot;evolution is related to the process of life coming into being,&quot; &quot;evolution is based on scientific data,&quot; &quot;evolution has not been proven,&quot; &quot;evolution has been proven,&quot; &quot;evolution is independent of religious belief,&quot; &quot;evolution is related to religious belief&quot; and &quot;there is no evolution.&quot; It was seen that knowledge of evolution changed after participating in a course, but perceptions on evolution did not change.",

This study attempts to build upon previous work by investigating teachers' views of evolution standards and their evolution practices in a state where evolution standards have been much-contested. This study employed a sequential explanatory mixed methods approach investigating the views of 129 Ohio high school biology teachers. Participants completed two surveys targeting their views of evolution standards and evolution teaching practices. Using a checklist, participants also indicated the evolution topics they addressed. All participants were invited to provide qualitative responses to the survey, and 16% of the respondents answered four open-ended questions via a follow-up email. Overall, teachers regarded evolution standards positively and reported spending an average of 11.6 hours teaching evolution. With respect to specific evolution teaching practices, teachers most often indicated that they addressed the mechanism of natural selection, anatomical evidence for evolution, adaptation, fossil record, connections between genetics and evolution, and information about Charles Darwin. Furthermore, statistical comparisons revealed that teachers who held more positive views of the evolution standards covered more standards-based and non-standards based evolutionary topics than their less positive colleagues.

        "description":"The social controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution puts pressure on secondary biology teachers to deemphasize or omit evolution from their curriculum. In this growing pressure, professional development can offer support to biology teachers. In this study, we surveyed secondary biology teachers in Missouri and report the data from teachers who are teaching evolution (N = 276). Teachers were asked to self-report their content understanding of evolution topics, the nature of their evolution teaching practice, their level of familiarity with available evolution education resources, obstacles they perceived as barriers to their evolution instruction, and their self-reported professional development (PD) needs related to evolution education. Seventy-five percent of teachers reported having an adequate understanding of all the listed evolution topics. Sixty percent of teachers reported teaching evolution as a unifying theme as well as including a unit devoted to evolution. Natural selection and nature of science were the most commonly taught topics. Teachers identified the lack of good labs and supplemental materials as their two biggest obstacles to teaching evolution. Teachers were not familiar with available evolution education resources. Teachers expressed interest in many aspects of professional development with over 75% of teachers reporting that they wanted &quot;some emphasis&quot; or &quot;great emphasis&quot; placed on every topic listed. In particular, teachers reported they wanted PD that placed a great emphasis on current research in evolution, labs/investigations using real data and/or live organisms, evolution simulations, contemporary evolution examples, and misconceptions.

Evolution teachers face several challenges including limited content knowledge, personal conflicts with evolution, expectations of resistance, concerns about students' conflicts with religion, and curricular constraints. Evolution teaching can be particularly challenging for student teachers who are just beginning to gain pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge related to evolution teaching and who seek approval from university supervisors and cooperating teachers. Science teacher educators need to know how to best support student teachers as they broach the sometimes daunting task of teaching evolution within student teaching placements. This multiple case study report documents how three student teachers approached evolution instruction and what influenced their approaches. Data sources included student teacher interviews, field note observations for 4-5 days of evolution instruction, and evolution instructional artifacts. Data were analyzed using grounded theory approaches to develop individual cases and a cross-case analysis. Seven influences (state exams and standards, cooperating teacher, ideas about teaching and learning, concerns about evolution controversy, personal commitment to evolution, knowledge and preparation for teaching evolution, and own evolution learning experiences) were identified and compared across cases. Implications for science teacher preparation and future research are provided.",

Developing a true understanding of evolution, however, can only be achieved through comprehensive education. In the community, teachers have an important role in removing erroneous attitudes toward evolution, in which science and biology teachers have a key role. This study aimed to reveal pre-service teachers' perspective on evolution by eliciting the opinions of science pre-service teachers who had attended a 14-week evolution course and those who had not yet taken this course using a delimited draft sentence. According to the data, students who had limited knowledge about evolution, either dogmatically rejected evolution or defined evolution in a simple way, as a change. The rate of rejecting the concept of evolution was decreased among the students who had taken the course about evolution. In addition, there was an increased ratio of those who described evolution using high-level knowledge and a non-rejecting style. Another interesting outcome mentioned in the statements of the students was that keeping the content of the course as wide as possible reduced prejudice against the concept of evolution, decreased rejection rate, and also allowed students to change the erroneous/incorrect ideas that they previously held about evolution.",

However, community college students tend to be more diverse in characteristics shown to be related to evolution education outcomes. To explore how studies involving university students may generalize to community college students, we surveyed students from seven community college (n = 202) and nine university (n = 2288) classes. We measured students' evolution interest, acceptance, and understanding, and for religious students, we measured their perceived conflict between their religions and evolution. Controlling for state and major, we found that community college students had similar levels of evolution interest as university students but perceived greater conflict between their religions and evolution. Further, community college students had lower evolution understanding and acceptance compared with university students. Religiosity was a strong factor predicting community college and university students' evolution acceptance. However, unique to community college students, evolution understanding was not related to their macroevolution or human evolution acceptance. This indicates that, although some results between community college and university students are similar, there are differences that have implications for evolution instruction that warrant the need for more evolution education research at community colleges.",

However, we do not currently know how instructors perceive their role in helping students accept evolution or how they address the perceived conflict between religion and evolution when they teach evolution. This study explores instructor practices and beliefs related to mitigating students' perceived conflict between religion and evolution. Interviews with 32 instructors revealed that many instructors do not believe it is their goal to help students accept evolution and that most instructors do not address the perceived conflict between religion and evolution. Instructors cited many barriers to discussing religion in the context of evolution in their classes, most notably the instructors' own personal beliefs that religion and evolution may be incompatible. These data are exploratory and are intended to stimulate a series of questions about how we as college biology instructors teach evolution.",

        "description":"Although most high school students want their biology classes to include evolution, most high school biology classes in Minnesota do not emphasize evolution. This lack of an emphasis on evolution defies state educational standards and is associated with most students (high school and college) having serious misconceptions about evolution. The evolution-related views of students in religiously-affiliated high schools are not necessarily more scientifically inaccurate than those of students at public schools. These results are discussed relative to the teaching of evolution and the problems of surveying students in public and private schools. The authors recommend that, when designing a survey-based study of students' understandings of evolution-related topics, teachers should include a plan for how they will handle delays that might accompany resistance.

        "description":"Students' religious beliefs and religious cultures have been shown to be the main factors predicting whether they will accept evolution, yet college biology instructors teaching evolution at public institutions often have religious beliefs and cultures that are different from their religious students. This difference in religious beliefs and cultures may be a barrier to effective evolution education. To explore when evolution instructors have similar religious cultures and beliefs as their students, we interviewed 32 evolution instructors at Christian universities nationwide about their practices and experiences teaching evolution. Christian university instructors emphasized teaching for acceptance of evolution while holding an inclusive teaching philosophy that they perceived led to a safe environment for students. Additionally, almost all instructors reported using practices that have been shown to increase student acceptance of evolution and reduce student conflict between evolution and religion. Further, we found that these instructors perceived that their own religious backgrounds have guided their decisions to teach evolution to their students in a culturally competent way. We discuss how these data, combined with past research literature on public college instructors, indicate that cultural competence could be a useful new framework for promoting effective evolution education in higher education institutions.",

        "description":"Low acceptance of evolution among undergraduate students is common and is best predicted by religious beliefs. Decreasing students' perceived conflict between religion and evolution could increase their acceptance of evolution. However, college biology instructors may struggle with trying to decrease students' perceived conflict between religion and evolution because of differences in the religious cultures and beliefs of instructors and students. Although a large percentage of undergraduate students in evolution courses are religious, most instructors teaching evolution are not. To consider differences between the secular culture of many college instructors and the religious culture of many students, we propose using a lens of cultural competence to create effective evolution education. Cultural competence is the ability of individuals from one culture (in this case, primarily secular instructors who are teaching evolution) to bridge cultural differences and effectively communicate with individuals from a different culture (in this case, primarily religious undergraduate biology students). We call this new framework Religious Cultural Competence in Evolution Education (ReCCEE). In this essay, we describe a suite of culturally competent practices that can help instructors reduce students' perceived conflict between evolution and religion, increase students' acceptance of evolution, and help create more inclusive undergraduate biology classrooms.",

This survey was administered to 229 Indiana biology teachers. Data were analyzed using the Rasch model to convert Likert rating scale data into ratio data used for parametric analyses. Correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between use of standards and attitude toward standards, attitude toward standards and evolution teaching practices, and attitude toward evolution standards and days teaching evolution. These findings suggest practical relationships between standards use, teachers' regard of standards, and evolution teaching practices.",

        "author":["Chen, Li-Hua"],
        "description":"Evolution is the cornerstone of biological sciences, but anti-evolution teaching has become a global controversy since the introduction of evolutionary ideas into the United States high school science curricula in 1914. It is suggested that teachers' attitude toward and acceptance of the theory of evolution will influence their effect of teaching of evolution. There are numerous studies suggesting that a lack of understanding of evolution and the nature of science will undermine their acceptance of the theory of evolution. Research regarding acceptance of and understanding of evolution and the nature of science has been widely investigated in many countries, but none has been done by Taiwanese educational researchers. The purpose of this study was to describe Taiwanese high school biology teachers' acceptance of evolution and understanding of evolution and understanding of the nature of science. Demographic variables and academic variables thought to influence the acceptance of evolution and understanding of evolution and understanding of the nature of science were also examined. A 68-item questionnaire was used to collect data from 302 Taiwanese high school biology teachers who taught at least two hours of high school biology during the school year 2014-15. The response rate was 41.4%. Teachers showed high levels of acceptance and understanding of evolutionary theory. Their understanding of the nature of science was moderate. The data revealed significantly positive relationships in teachers' acceptance of evolution and understanding of evolution, and understanding of the nature of science. Among the variables examined, teachers' total number of credit hours in biology at university level had significant effects on teachers' understanding of evolution and understanding of the nature of science. The regression analysis revealed that teachers' religious beliefs, understanding of evolution, gender, understanding of the nature of science, and completion of a course in evolution were significantly predictive of teachers' acceptance of evolution. Christianity and female gender were negative predictors; while academic variables, understanding of evolution and understanding of the nature of science, and completion of a course in evolution could foster acceptance of evolution.

        "description":"This critical analysis examined research on evolution in the United States between the years 2000-2014, spanning early classroom implementation of the National Science Education Standards to current research findings. First, we sought to understand how the research literature published between 2000 and 2014 contributed to knowledge of evolution education as well as areas required to further illuminate our understanding of evolutionary acceptance and rejection. Two hundred thirteen studies were reviewed using identified criteria that included the approach to teaching, attitudes and perceptions, religiosity, and proposed teaching methods, with particular emphasis on evolution teaching and learning. Following multiple rounds of article examination, seven general directions appear to be present in evolution education research: (1) approach to evolution in the classroom; (2) knowledge, understanding, and acceptance of evolution; (3) attitudes and perceptions of evolution; (4) factors impacting the teaching and learning of evolution; (5) evolution conflict and coping strategies; (6) evolution and religiosity; and (7) proposed evolution teaching method, courses, and assessment. The analysis pointed to four areas in need of further exploration: (1) elaboration on how worldview affects acceptance; (2) exploration of specific factors (intrinsic and extrinsic) that influence the acceptance of evolution; (3) examination of experiences to define these factors, especially among preservice teachers; and (4) exploration of evolution acceptance across geographical regions of the United States.",

        "description":"While many states are facing challenges to the teaching of evolution in their science classrooms, the University of California Museum of Paleontology, working with the National Center for Science Education, has developed a useful web-based resource for science teachers of all grade- and experience-levels. Understanding Evolution (UE) was developed in January 2004 in response to teachers' needs for science content, teaching resources, and teaching strategies. The UE website at http://evolution.berkeley.edu has since been expanded to include more resources for teachers, students, and the general public. Rather than focusing on the controversy over evolution, the site concentrates on the science of evolution and provides resources for effective teaching. Thus the cladogram has two distinct lineages--content and resources--labeled &quot;Learning Evolution&quot; and &quot;Teaching Evolution.&quot; Learning Evolution is a handy resource for teachers who want to brush up on their background knowledge on the nature of science and evolution, as well as for those for whom evolution is a relatively new topic. Teaching Evolution provides the resources for including evolution as an integral part of K-12 science curricula. The summative evaluation of the original site for teachers was astonishingly positive. Pre- and post-tests from a broad spectrum of teachers revealed an average increase of understanding of 12%. Along with this increase in understanding comes an increase in confidence to teach evolution, which is really the goal of this project. (Contains 2 figures.)",
