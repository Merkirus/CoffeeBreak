We examined the acceptance of evolution theory and we also looked into the relationship between the acceptance and parents' education level, thinking dispositions and frequency of religious practice as independent variables. Students' moderate acceptance of evolution theory is positively correlated with the frequency of religious practices and thinking dispositions. Our findings indicate that studying a controversial issue such as the acceptance of evolution theory in a multivariate fashion, using conceptual ecology as a theoretical lens to interpret the findings, is informative. They also indicate the differences that exist between societies and how socio-cultural factors such as the nature of religion, as part of the conceptual ecology, influence acceptance of evolution and have an influence on evolution education.

EcoEvo-MAPS targets foundational concepts in ecology and evolution and uses a novel approach that asks students to evaluate a series of predictions, conclusions, or interpretations as likely or unlikely to be true given a specific scenario. We collected evidence of validity and reliability for EcoEvo-MAPS through an iterative process of faculty review, student interviews, and analyses of assessment data from more than 3000 students at 34 associate's-, bachelor's-, master's-, and doctoral-granting institutions. The 63 likely/unlikely statements range in difficulty and target student understanding of key concepts aligned with the &quot;Vision and Change&quot; report. This assessment provides departments with a tool to measure student thinking at different time points in the curriculum and provides data that can be used to inform curricular and instructional modifications.",

Sections include: (1) &quot;Galapagos: Frame of Reference&quot;; (2) &quot;Ecology and Islands&quot;; and (3) &quot;Evolution.&quot; Nineteen standards-based activities use the Galapagos Islands as a running theme but are designed to help students make connections to their local environments. In addition to linking to the National Science Education Standards, each activity has assessment suggestions, rubrics, and Internet extensions through the National Science Teachers Association's (NSTA) SciLinks program. Using hands-on activities, games, and research suggestions, students learn how the factors that shape evolutionary processes--adaptation and natural selection--are  influenced by ecological pressures. The complex relationship between ecology and evolution is demonstrated and reiterated throughout the book. The activities demonstrate how islands are formed and the role currents play in weather patterns, which in turn affect the climate and the life forms that can survive. Students make food webs under a variety of circumstances, both for a Galapagos marine environment as well as their own local community, then modify those food webs based on factors such as changes in climate (El Nino, for example) or the introduction of competitive alien species. Plant and animal biodiversity and dependent relationships within an ecosystem are discussed in detail. (CCM)",

        "description":"&quot;Classic&quot; forest plots show the effect sizes from individual studies and the aggregate effect from a meta-analysis. However, in ecology and evolution, meta-analyses routinely contain over 100 effect sizes, making the classic forest plot of limited use. We surveyed 102 meta-analyses in ecology and evolution, finding that only 11% use the classic forest plot. Instead, most used a &quot;forest-like plot,&quot; showing point estimates (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) from a series of subgroups or categories in a meta-regression. We propose a modification of the forest-like plot, which we name the &quot;orchard plot.&quot; Orchard plots, in addition to showing overall mean effects and CIs from meta-analyses/regressions, also include 95% prediction intervals (PIs), and the individual effect sizes scaled by their precision. The PI allows the user and reader to see the range in which an effect size from a future study may be expected to fall. The PI, therefore, provides an intuitive interpretation of any heterogeneity in the data. Supplementing the PI, the inclusion of underlying effect sizes also allows the user to see any influential or outlying effect sizes. We showcase the orchard plot with example datasets from ecology and evolution, using the R package, &quot;orchard,&quot; including several functions for visualizing meta-analytic data using forest-plot derivatives. We consider the orchard plot as a variant on the classic forest plot, cultivated to the needs of meta-analysts in ecology and evolution. Hopefully, the orchard plot will prove fruitful for visualizing large collections of heterogeneous effect sizes regardless of the field of study.",

        "description":"In this study, we make an effort to compare studies that explore the factors related to acceptance of evolutionary theory among Greek and Turkish students-future teachers, using conceptual ecology for biological evolution as the theoretical framework. We aimed to look into the acceptance and the understanding of evolutionary theory and also to look into the relationship of the acceptance with understanding of evolutionary theory, parents' educational level, thinking dispositions and frequency of religious practising as independent variables by the use of studies conducted in both countries. Both studies found a correlation between students' understanding of evolutionary theory with acceptance of evolutionary theory, the same was recorded for religious practising and acceptance of evolution. A difference was observed in the case of contribution of parents' educational level and acceptance of evolution, where, we did not find any significant positive correlation between parents' educational level and acceptance of evolution, while that was true for Turkish society. Our findings with the comparative study of this type indicate that studying a controversial issue such as the acceptance of evolutionary theory in a multivariate fashion, using conceptual ecology as a theoretical lens to interpret the findings, is informative. They also, indicate the differences that exist from society to society and how sociocultural factors such as the type of religion as part of the conceptual ecology influence acceptance of evolution and have strong influence on evolution education.",
