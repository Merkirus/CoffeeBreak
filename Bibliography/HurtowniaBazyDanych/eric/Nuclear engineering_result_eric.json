        "description":"Several areas that are lacking in undergraduate nuclear engineering programs are discussed. Although most programs provide adequate theoretical knowledge in nuclear science, the nuclear engineer must have a working knowledge with the complete nuclear power plant, and be acquainted with the functions and responsibilities of the various segments of the nuclear industry and of the federal and state agencies under whose regulation the entire industry must operate. Suggestions are given for means of incorporating these practical aspects into nuclear engineering programs. (MLH)",

The elements of a safeguard system and factors influencing the selection of a particular system are presented. Projections concerning the use of nuclear Power in the 1980's are cited as evidence of the need for engineering courses specializing in this area. The author states that while all engineering students should receive a \"general orientation\" to the topic, the low number of engineers electing nuclear materials safeguards as a profession will limit the feasibility of semester courses in materials and safeguards to a few institutions which are strong in the teaching of the  nuclear fuel cycle and fuel management.

This paper discusses our experience and assessment of the interdisciplinary computer and nuclear energy course, which was developed and offered primarily to ECE students at Howard University. A unique team-teaching model utilized with ECE professors and nuclear field experts was applied to teach the two diverse subjects: computer safety and nuclear energy. The survey result from the first offering of the course showed a very positive response from the majority of the students about the team-teaching method and the knowledge acquired on the two subjects.",

        "description":"The nuclear engineer emerged as a new form of recognised technical professional between 1940 and the early 1960s as nuclear fission, the chain reaction and their applications were explored. The institutionalization of nuclear engineering--channelled into new national laboratories and corporate design offices during the decade after the war, and hurried into academic venues thereafter--proved unusually dependent on government definition and support. This paper contrasts the distinct histories of the new discipline in the USA and UK (and, more briefly, Canada). In the segregated and influential environments of institutional laboratories and factories, historical actors such as physicist Walter Zinn in the USA and industrial chemist Christopher Hinton in the UK proved influential in shaping the roles and perceptions of nuclear specialists. More broadly, I argue that the State-managed implantation of the new subject within further and higher education curricula was shaped strongly by distinct political and economic contexts in which secrecy, postwar prestige and differing industrial cultures were decisive factors.",

The study is a form of empirical research. The results and findings regarding implementation of the CDIO approach are presented in relation to the Russia-Kazakhstan network programme of specialist training for the nuclear industry of Kazakhstan. The authors conclude that CDIO ideas effectively promote solutions to educational challenges facing the nuclear industries of specific countries. Key findings are (a) that the network form of education is well-suited to the implementation of the CDIO approach and (b) that the principle of the safe management of nuclear materials should be considered in the context of engineering education.",
