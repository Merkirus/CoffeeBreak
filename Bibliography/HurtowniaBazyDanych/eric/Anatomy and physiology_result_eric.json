        "description":"Given the ever-increasing diversity of both the global and national community, diversity and inclusion are critical topics for consideration in healthy organizational settings. Promotion of diversity and inclusion is especially important for institutions of higher learning since diverse and inclusive environments more accurately teach learners about the real world, provide impetus for social change, and improve individuals' skills of cross-cultural interaction. The benefits of diversity and inclusion can be experienced in the anatomical sciences, including human anatomy and physiology, when course content has relevant connections to topics of diversity and when these topics are in alignment with standard learning goals or competencies. While some organizations, including anatomy and anatomy and physiology educators, have established policies, standards, or objectives for diversity and inclusion, there are many other professional societies relevant to anatomy and/or physiology that have not adopted such guidelines. Anatomy and anatomy and physiology educators also benefit from a more diverse working environment, multicultural interactions with other individuals at their institutions or professional meetings, and diversification of anatomy instruction in the classroom with effective technology and teaching methods. The applications of diversity and inclusion foster more culturally educated and enriched global societies and anatomy and physiology communities.",

        "description":"Introductory anatomy and physiology courses are either taught as discipline-specific courses (human anatomy and human physiology) or integrated sequences [combined human anatomy and physiology (A&amp;P I and A&amp;P II)]. This variation suggests there is no agreed upon pedagogical standard for teaching introductory anatomy and physiology. We surveyed undergraduate students enrolled in human anatomy, human physiology, A&amp;P I, and A&amp;P II to determine their course approach preference, either discipline-specific or an integrated A&amp;P sequence, and the underlying reasons for their preferences. The literature suggests that understanding students' preferred learning environment influences learner satisfaction, level of achievement, and socioemotional adjustment in the classroom. Our qualitative analysis revealed students prefer an integrated A&amp;P course approach to a discipline-specific sequence with &quot;building on prior knowledge,&quot; &quot;easier,&quot; and &quot;increased understanding&quot; emerging as the top reasons for their preferences. Our findings have implications for course design and curricular reforms.",

        "description":"Providing word banks for human anatomy and physiology lab practicals is uncommon because instructors want to avoid cueing effects, but there is little published data on their effects on student performance. In the 2016-2017 academic year, word banks were not provided for students taking lab practicals in Anatomy and Physiology I and II while in 2017-2018 alphabetized word banks were provided. All other aspects of the courses remained the same. Student performance was significantly higher, though the effect size was small, on both lab practicals in Anatomy and Physiology I (p&lt;0.001 for each) and the first lab practical in Anatomy and Physiology II (p&lt;0.001). Scores on the 2nd lab practical in Anatomy and Physiology II and each lecture-lab course score were not affected by the provision of word banks. Results of this study will be useful when making decisions about providing word banks for lab practicals, weighting lab practicals for calculating grades, and responding to disability accommodation requests.",

In a voluntary writing activity on the last day of the two-semester anatomy and physiology class, students were asked to write a letter to the next year's students to offer advice on how to pass the course, no further direction or guidance of what to write was provided. Data consisted of 283 open letters containing each student's voice, broken down into &quot;in vivo&quot; codes. Several themes emerged from the codes. Essays recognized the value of study and learning skills, while also voicing negative affective feelings towards the anatomy and physiology course, suggesting that many students were unprepared for this college level course.

Many students find anatomy and physiology classes academically challenging and institutions across the country report high failure and withdrawal rates for these courses. Although research has shown that several factors may contribute to poor student performance, this study focused on the relationship between a student's major and their perceptions about the course to investigate whether these data were reflective of student success rates. Survey data was collected from students in the first semester of a two-semester, systems-based human anatomy and physiology course sequence. While the results did not show a statistical difference in successful completion of the anatomy and physiology course related to academic major, interesting preferences regarding learning styles, study habits, and perceived difficulty of the course were found.",

This study explored the use of a student response system that was easy to use, cost-efficient, and re-usable for multiple anatomy and physiology courses. More specifically, the impact of i&gt;clickers on student performance in anatomy and physiology courses was investigated by comparing exam scores before and after the introduction of i&gt;clickers. This study showed that the use of i&gt;clickers during the lecture courses increased student engagement and improved the performance of students on the lecture exams covering the respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive, lymphatic, and immune systems. The overall performance of students in the anatomy and physiology lecture courses had also a tendency to increase. Furthermore, student feedback regarding i&gt;clicker use was highly positive.",

Through a mixed-methods exploratory study, this research sought to determine undergraduate student perceptions of anatomy through this curricular revision. Data was collected through word associations, open-ended surveys, and course evaluation data. Our results indicate that undergraduate student perceptions of anatomy changed between the first course and the second course in the sequence, rather than between course approaches. Students in both course approaches reported similar interests, confusions, and difficulties related to anatomy education, and an awareness of the explicit and implicit curriculum was evident in student responses. However, some specific evaluation prompts exhibited a significant difference between course approaches. Results from this perception study can guide practitioners to consider the curricular context and unique challenges of anatomy and physiology students in meeting the expectations of the health care field.",

However, research demonstrates that, when instructors utilize active learning approaches (such as in laboratory settings) where students participate in their own learning, students have improved outcomes, such as higher test scores and better retention of material. To provide community college students with opportunities for active learning in physiology, we developed two laboratory exercises to engage students in cardiac and skeletal muscle physiology. We utilized low-cost SpikerBox devices to measure electrical activity during cardiac (electrocardiogram) and skeletal muscle (electromyogram) contraction. Laboratory activities were employed in Anatomy and Physiology courses at two community colleges in southeast Michigan. A 2-h laboratory period was structured with a 20-min slide presentation covering background material on the subject and experiments to examine the effects of environmental variables on nervous system control of cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction. Students were asked to provide hypotheses and proposed mechanisms, complete a results section, and provide conclusions for the experiments based on their results. Our laboratory exercises improved student learning in physiology and knowledge of the scientific method and were well-received by community college students enrolled in Anatomy and Physiology. Our results demonstrate that the use of a SpikerBox for cardiac and skeletal muscle physiology concepts is a low-cost and effective approach to integrate physiology activities into an Anatomy and Physiology course.",
