        "description":"This report contains recommendations on advanced university curricula in ocean engineering and related areas, emphasizing the needs of developing countries. A decision matrix is included to assist users in developing the necessary criteria for designing appropriate curricula to prepare university students for careers in different ocean engineering fields. Examples of curricula in four fields are presented to illustrate use of the matrix. They include: (1) offshore structural engineering; (2) coastal and nearshore engineering; (3) ocean instrumentation; and (4) fisheries engineering. Discussions on necessary and desirable requirements for introducing advanced ocean engineering curricula in terms of human resources, physical facilities, and teaching aids are also presented. In  addition, recommendations for the strengthening of ocean engineering in general are provided. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"A global survey was conducted to: (1) determine what universities have ocean engineering curricula; (2) obtain information on the nature of these curricula; and (3) determine the similarity of curricula by noting the frequence of occurrence of specific courses or subjects. Results indicate that at least 97 academic institutions in 19 countries have ocean engineering postgraduate curricula. The top four countries having undergraduate and postgraduate curricula include the United States with 25 universities, the United Kingdom with 14, and Japan and China with 11 and 10 respectively. Ocean engineering, as exemplified by the curricula in the institutions surveyed, includes the subfields of harbor and coastal engineering, offshore engineering, marine technology, and the more  traditional fields of naval architecture and marine engineering. There exists a definite similarity of subjects or courses included in most ocean engineering curricula. Although a number of institutions have postgraduate degrees in ocean engineering, most degrees are in one of the traditional engineering fields or undesignated by discipline. (The major portion of this document consists of a list of universities, by country, having postgraduate curricula in ocean engineering. Location, courses and degrees offered, degree requirements, and other information are provided for each entry.) (Author/JN)",

        "description":"In order to determine the potential utilization of displaced aerospace and defense technical professionals in oceanography and ocean engineering, a study of ocean-oriented industry in Florida and Southern California was conducted by The National Society of Professional Engineers for the U.S. Department of Labor. After recent consolidation, this industry is operating well below full capability. Mainly as a result of increased federal activities in the oceans, moderate job expansion in selected areas is expected in the next few years. Short-term potential for utilization of professional manpower has been identified in the fields of naval architecture, oceanographic research, and data acquisition and management. Increased use of aerospace and defense manpower will be promoted by a  trend towards rapidly broadening interests of the ocean-oriented community and increasing alignment of oceanography and ocean engineering goals. Realistic on-the-job training programs can enhance effective vocational orientation, perhaps in conjunction with current federally sponsored research and development programs. To reflect geographical differences in results, the San Diego and the Florida team reports are presented separately. Related chapters are announced as VT 018 435-018 451 in this issue. (Author/AG)",
