        "author":["Metsämuuronen, Jari"],
        "description":"A new index of item discrimination power (IDP), dimension-corrected Somers' D (D2) is proposed. Somers' D is one of the superior alternatives for item-total- (Rit) and item-rest correlation (Rir) in reflecting the real IDP with items with scales 0/1 and 0/1/2, that is, up to three categories. D also reaches the extreme value +1 and -1 correctly while Rit and Rir cannot reach the ultimate values in the real-life testing settings. However, when the item has four categories or more, Somers' D underestimates IDP more than Pearson correlation. A simple correction to Somers' D in the polytomous case seems to lead to be effective in item analysis settings. In the simulation with real-life items, D2 showed very few cases of obvious underestimation and practically no cases of obvious overestimation. With certain restrictions discussed in the article, D2 seems to be a good alternative for these classic estimators not only with dichotomous items but also with the polytomous ones. In general, the magnitudes of the estimates by D2 are higher than those by Rit, Rir, and polychoric correlation and they seem to be close of those of bi- and polyserial correlation coefficients without out-of-range values.",

It suggests that the film material is appropriate for the study of U.S. history, U.S. literature, psychology, law, geography, underwater archeology, and naval and maritime history. The guide is divided into 11 sections, as follows: The Making of the Documentary Film; The U.S. Brig Somers--A Shipwreck from the Mexican War; The Mutiny, Herman Melville &amp; Billy Budd; The Controversy; The Mexican War; Underwater Archeology; Characters in the Documentary Film--19th Century; Characters in  the Documentary Film--20th Century; Traditional Music and Sea Shanties; Vocabulary and Terminology; and Recommended Bibliography.

        "description":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between item g and test score X, known as item-test or item-total correlation (&quot;Rit&quot;), and item-rest correlation (&quot;Rir&quot;) are two of the most used classical estimators for item discrimination power (IDP). Both &quot;Rit&quot; and &quot;Rir&quot; underestimate IDP caused by the mismatch of the scales of the item and the score. Underestimation of IDP may be drastic when the difficulty level of the item is extreme. Based on a simulation, in a binary dataset, a good alternative for &quot;Rit&quot; and &quot;Rir&quot; could be the Somers' &quot;D&quot;: it reaches the ultimate values +1 and -1, it underestimates IDP remarkably less than &quot;Rit&quot; and &quot;Rir&quot;, and, being a robust statistic, it is more stable against the changes in the data structure. Somers' &quot;D&quot; has, however, one major disadvantage in a polytomous case: it tends to underestimate the magnitude of the association of item and score more than &quot;Rit&quot; does when the item scale has four categories or more.",

        "description":"In this paper, we explore algebra students' mathematical realities around fractions and division, and the ways in which students reinvented mathematical productions involving fractions and division. We find that algebra students' initial realities do not include the fraction-as-quotient sub-construct. This can be problematic because in algebra, quotients are almost always represented as fractions. In a design experiment, students progressively reinvented the fraction-as-quotient sub-construct. Analyzing this experiment, we find that a particular type of mathematical production, which we call preformal productions, played two meditational roles: (1) they mediated mathematical activity, and (2) they mediated the reinvention of more formal mathematical productions. We suggest that preformal productions may emerge even when they are not designed for, and we show how preformal productions embody historic classroom activity and social interaction.",

It was found that almost half of the audiovisual productions appropriate for the junior high and high school levels had been produced in the past three years, and that the largest number of productions were documentaries. Most were acceptable in terms of technical production and/or content, and there was a significant number of very high quality productions in this area. In the experience of  the review panel, the year of production was not an effective criterion for judging the usefulness of audiovisual materials, i.e., new was not better. Recent documentaries often involve brief interviews with or comments by youth or groups of youths who speak powerfully for themselves about self-destructive behavior. While earlier documentaries focused on warning signs and case findings, more recent presentations focus on available resources and solutions for young people. A full catalog of these audiovisual productions is available from SIEC, which intends to continue to update the catalog. (EW)",

        "description":"Purpose: Research examining the relationship between spontaneous and imitated productions for phonological analysis has indicated that the inclusion of imitated productions may overestimate children's phonological abilities. Previous research in this area has included only English-speaking children. The purpose of this study was to determine what, if any, differences there were in the spontaneous and imitated productions of Spanish-speaking children with phonological disorders. Method: Twelve Spanish-speaking children with phonological disorders (5 boys and 7 girls), ranging in age from 3;1 (years;months) to 4;9 (M=3;11), participated in the study. Their spontaneous and imitated productions, based on a sample of single words, were analyzed to determine which elicitation task yielded the more adult-like production. Differences in consonant accuracy between the two tasks were analyzed, as was the shift in error type from spontaneous to imitated productions. Results: The results indicated that spontaneous and imitated productions were identical in 62% of the cases, an imitated production was more adult-like than a spontaneous one in 25% of the cases, and a spontaneous form was more adult-like than an imitated one in approximately 13% of the cases. Consonant accuracy for some children also varied as a function of elicitation task. Clinical Implications: For additional diagnostic and prognostic value, speech-language pathologists can incorporate imitated responses in their analyses.",
