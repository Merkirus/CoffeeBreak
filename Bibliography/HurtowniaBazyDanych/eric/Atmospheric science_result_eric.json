        "description":"Computational and atmospheric chemistry are two important branches of contemporary chemistry. With the present topical nature of climate change and global warming, it is more crucial than ever that students are aware of and exposed to atmospheric chemistry, with an emphasis on how modeling may aid in understanding how atmospherically relevant chemical compounds interact with incoming solar radiation. Nonetheless, computational and atmospheric chemistry are under-represented in most undergraduate chemistry curricula. In this manuscript, we describe a simple and efficient method for simulating the electronic absorption spectral profiles of atmospherically relevant molecules that may be utilized in an undergraduate computer laboratory. The laboratory results give students hands-on experience in computational and atmospheric chemistry, as well as electronic absorption spectroscopy.",

Comparing by subject category shows that Scopus has hundreds of unique titles, and Web of Science just 16. The titles unique to each database have low SCImago Journal Rank Indicators (Scopus) and Impact Factors (Web of Science), thus indicating that the unique titles play a minor role within this discipline. An author affiliation search reveals that both databases cover most of the important literature in earth and atmospheric sciences. In subject searches, the titles unique to each database depend upon the specific topic searched. Most of the earth and atmospheric sciences doctoral-granting institutions in the United States subscribe to Web of Science rather than Scopus, while some institutions apparently consider these databases complementary, and subscribe to both of them, in spite of their high subscription costs. Our method of comparing large numbers of titles among different databases needs only a word processor and is readily applicable to any subject area or applicable even to the entire lists of journals in any set of databases.
