In the analysis of the contents of paleontology in geography textbooks, these books are important because they reveal problems embedded in these works and allow a more informed choice of books for the approach. In this work we performed an analysis of the approach of the contents of paleontology in textbooks of geography, from the perspective of knowing the reality of the current placement of this theme in the books and provided information on the textbooks about the paleontological theme. Five textbooks for geography fundamental schools were chosen, where the basic themes of Paleontology were analyzed. Works examined, four have good approach, including detailed descriptions of the main themes of paleontology. Thus, conceptual definitions were found and described superficially; moreover, new concepts and approaches of scientific knowledge have rarely been incorporated in these teaching materials. We also emphasize the need to consult the recent books of paleontology for the upgrade of the works analyzed, and a better integration of paleontological concepts with other geological interrelated themes. Additionally, improvements in explanations of complex topics are suggested.",
