        "description":"This article presents a brief overview of developments in educational psychology over the last twenty-five years. It firstly presents an historical context by reviewing four basic emphases in educational psychology; cognitive psychology, behavioural psychology, social cognitive theory and humanism. The article then reviews the growth in cognitive psychology research by briefly examining developments arising from Piagetian, Vygotskian and information processing theories. The article examines the development of constructivist approaches to learning and teaching, and the growth in cognitive theories of motivation. Cross-cultural, methodological and other developments in educational psychology are also briefly examined. The article concludes with five paradoxes to stimulate the reader to consider some implications of this 25 year overview.",

Understanding the cognitive processes involved when students learn from others is important for creating group situations that facilitate learning. Research from cognitive psychology predicts who will learn most from whom and in what situations. It also provides a set of methods that education researchers can use to further explore &quot;Learning from Others.&quot; However, because the goals of cognitive psychologists and educators often differ, it is important to apply cognitive psychology research cautiously within an educational context.",

Under \"Methodological Issues\" are: (7) \"Structure and Process in Cognitive Psychology Using Multidimensional Scaling and Related Techniques\" (Edward J. Shoben and Brian H.
