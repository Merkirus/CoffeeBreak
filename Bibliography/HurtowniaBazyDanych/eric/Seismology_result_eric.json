        "description":"This report is the result of a workshop conducted by the Committee on Seismology of the National Research Council to review the field of seismology, its importance in many and diverse areas of national interest, and its future course. This report is intended to be useful not only to the scientific and technical communities but also to the decision-makers who are seeking solutions to critical national problems. This report may also be of use to earth science teachers and school guidance personnel as a supplemental reference in the field of seismology. The report reviews the history, accomplishments and status of seismology; assesses changing trends in seismological research and applications; and recommends future directions in the light of these changes and of the growing needs of  society in areas in which seismology can make significant contributions.

King Edward VI High School for Girls was one of the fortunate schools to obtain a school seismometer system, free of charge, as an early adopter of the resource. This report outlines our experiences with the system over the past 10 years and describes our recent research on the relationship between background noise on seismogram records and ocean wave activity. We hope to inspire other schools to undertake pupil research in seismology.",

Seismology is the (1) study of earthquakes; (2) origin, propagation, and energy of seismic phenomena; (3) prediction of these phenomena; and (4) investigation of the structure of the earth. Earthquake engineering or engineering seismology includes the study of the behavior of foundations and structures, materials used in their construction in response to earthquakes, and techniques that lessen the effects of earthquakes on structures. This publication lists relevant sources of information on earthquakes, seismology, and earthquake engineering. Listed in this bibliography are (1) introductory materials, (2) subject headings, (3) basic texts, (4) additional titles, (5) specialized titles,  (6) handbooks, (7) bibliographies, (8) government publications, (9) conference proceedings, (10) abstracting and indexing services, (12) journals, (13) representative journal articles, (14) technical reports, (15) selected technical reports, (16) selected materials, and (17) additional sources of information.

This procedure was applied to the study of a seismology unit in a ninth-grade earth science classroom. An emergent coding scheme was developed that provided a description of the different activities, science content, and type of scientific data. Analysis of classroom discourse identified the ways the seismology unit can be understood as providing opportunities for students to engage in scientific inquiry. The analytic processes provides the basis for the examination of scientific inquiry in other settings. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",
