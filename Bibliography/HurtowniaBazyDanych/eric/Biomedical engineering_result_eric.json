        "description":"With increasing demand for improved medical equipment and healthcare, next-generation biomedical engineers need strong design skills. Equipping biomedical engineering students with tools for idea generation and development can increase student design success. Design Heuristics are an ideation tool developed through empirical studies of product designs. While identified in the mechanical engineering space, Design Heuristics may be applicable in biomedical engineering design. In our study, we implemented a Design Heuristics session during upper-level undergraduate and first-year graduate biomedical engineering design courses. We examined the applicability of Design Heuristics within individual and team concept generation contexts. The findings demonstrated that biomedical engineering students were able to use Design Heuristics to generate multiple concepts, and that initial concepts produced using Design Heuristics were carried over into final team design. The results support the applicability of Design Heuristics to student idea generation in biomedical engineering design.",

        "description":"In the industrialized nation, almost every facet of our lives is permeated by technological innovation at an accelerated pace. This is especially true in the areas related to health and medicine, which has further led to the evolution of a health care system that is technologically related and capable of providing a wide range of effective therapeutic and diagnostic treatments. The application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering, biology and medicine is Biomedical engineering. Biomedical engineering focuses on the advancements to improve human health at all possible levels. Biomedical engineering has emerged as a new area of research combining biology and medicine with technology, providing new designs and concepts of medical instrumentation for the diagnosis, cure and prevention of various diseases. Biomedical engineering in the last three decades has sustained growth in human resources along with the emergence of careers as graduates and postgraduates and apart from this research works, health care and technological development are some of its other aspects. The present paper will provide an insight into biomedical engineering and future scopes, specifically in India. Biomedical engineers use and apply knowledge of the modern biological principles in their designing process. A biomedical engineer can work in a wide variety of areas and disciplines. Apart from this, there are several opportunities in industries for innovations, designing and developing new techniques. In the last few years, biomedical engineering has emerged as a booming career as the area of work and research and the possibilities of innovations in this field are nearly endless. Thus, the future of biomedical engineering is tied to both the obstacles we face in the field of medical sciences and its advancements. Hence the use of the biomedical engineering method has become a necessity for human health, research and development.",

Background: While women have made gains in STEM, electrical and computer engineering programs award 13% of their Bachelor's degrees to women while bioengineering/biomedical engineering programs award over 40%. Prior work suggests that women's persistent under-representation in electrical and computer engingeering may be due to them being drawn into other disciplines. Women persist in engineering at similar rates as men, so a better understanding of early college attitudes is needed. Research Questions: (1) How are career outcome expectations associated to electrical engineering, computer engineering, and bioengineering/biomedical engineering? (2) What are females' interests in electrical engineering, computer engineering, and bioengineering/biomedical engineering? (3) Are outcome expectations and major interests distinct for female-identified students? Methodology: Regression analyses were conducted on multiply-imputed data of introductory engineering students at four public universities in the U.S. Findings: Students associate inventing/designing things and &quot;developing new knowledge and skills&quot; to electrical engineering, and associate inventing/designing things and &quot;working with people&quot; (negative) to computer engineering. Students associate helping others and &quot;supervising others&quot; (negative) to bioengineering/biomedical engineering. Female-identified students are less interested in electrical and computer engineering, more interested in bioengineering/biomedical engineering, and associate helping others to bioengineering/biomedical engineering more strongly.",

        "description":"Three-dimensional modeling and additive manufacturing technologies (i.e. 3D printing) have and will continue to revolutionize biomedical engineering. However, 3D printing within biomedical engineering contexts remains an area of limited focus within secondary education. Many secondary educators are not well prepared to teach about biomedical 3D printing applications. Hence, this study examined if professional development (PD) had an influence on high school biology, and technology and engineering (T&amp;E) educators' perceptions of teaching 3D printing concepts within biomedical engineering contexts. The PD included presentations from a panel of experts who had utilized 3D printing within biomedical applications at a nearby College of Medicine. The findings revealed a significant difference in the amount of 3D printing instruction that teachers reported providing in their courses prior to the PD, and the amount they planned to implement following the PD. Additional analyses discovered that male teachers reported a significantly greater increase in their perceptions of 3D printing than female teachers, and there was no significant difference between biology and T&amp;E educators' perceptions. This study provides implications for researchers, universities, and P-12 educators. The findings demonstrate that meaningful PD experiences can positively influence P-12 educators' perceptions and plans to integrate emerging biomedical engineering concepts in their courses.",
