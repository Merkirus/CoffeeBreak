        "description":"Cultivating students' key competencies contributes to students' adaptation to the fast developing intelligent era. Artificial intelligence education is an important way to cultivate students' key competencies. It is increasingly important to set up appropriate artificial intelligence courses at the fundamental education stage and cultivate students' key competencies via such courses. This paper describes quantitatively how AI courses cultivate students' key competencies. First, we analyze the necessity of artificial intelligence education at the fundamental education stage and the status quo of artificial intelligence education in China. Next, we elaborate the students' key competencies which is composed of knowledge competence, team competence and learning competence, and design the curriculum of artificial intelligence at the fundamental education stage. Finally, through collecting students' questionnaires, we analyze the relationship between the curriculum of artificial intelligence and the cultivation of students' key competencies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the 7 categories of artificial intelligence courses are beneficial to the cultivation of the six key sub-competencies of students. In addition, the problems in the current artificial intelligence curriculum are identified and suggestions for improvement are put forward.",

It is the subfield of computer science. Artificial intelligence is becoming a popular field in computer science as it has enhanced the human life in many areas. Artificial intelligence in the last two decades has greatly improved performance of the manufacturing, service sector and so in the field of education. Study in the field of artificial intelligence has given rise to the rapidly growing technology known as expert system. Application areas of artificial intelligence is heaving a huge impact on various fields of life as expert system is widely used in these days to solve the complex problems in various areas as education, engineering, business, medicine, weather forecasting etc. The areas employing the technology of artificial intelligence have seen an increase in the quality and efficiency. This paper gives an overview of this technology and the scope of artificial intelligence in different areas with special reference to the use of this technology in the field of education along with its meaning, searching techniques, inventions and future.",

        "description":"This issue of \"Information Technology Quarterly\" is devoted to the theme of \"Artificial Intelligence.\" It contains two major articles: (1) Artificial Intelligence and Law\" (D. Peter O'Neill and George D. Wood); (2) \"Artificial Intelligence: A Long and Winding Road\" (John J. Simon, Jr.). In addition, it contains two sidebars: (1) \"Calculating and Searching\"; (2) \"Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (Donald S. Bradshaw). The issue is designed to provide a historical perspective as well as to describe some specific applications of artificial intelligence and expert systems. Issues addressed in the first article include a brief history of law and artificial intelligence; efforts to apply artificial intelligence to the field of law; artificial intelligence and legal  reasoning; research into the cognitive processes of legal reasoning; Project PERICLES, a joint research endeavor between the Harvard Law School and Digital Equipment Corporation to study the uses of computer technology in the legal domain of landlord tenant law; and a description of cognition and law research. An expert system developed at Harvard (NOMOS--from the Greek concept of law) is described, including implementation methods, modules, and system integration. The second article provides a history of the mechanization of human thought, citing the work of Plato, Descartes, Pascal, Charles Babbage, H. P. Babbage, Alan Turing, Claude Shannon, and others who laid the ground work for today's principles of artificial intelligence. More recent research in the field by American scientists is  also discussed, e.g., Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, J. C. Shaw, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Roger Schank, and Robert Wilensky. Several expert systems are also described. Each article includes its own list of references. (JB)",

It examined the factors that led educational administrators to adopt one artificial intelligence program (ALEKS) and their perceptions around the implementation process. Design/methodology/approach: This was a qualitative case study that included structured interviews with seven individuals who have adopted artificial intelligence programs in their schools. Participants were identified through purposive and snowball sampling. Interview transcripts were analyzed and put through a two-step coding process involving in vivo coding as well as pattern coding. Findings: Two major themes emerged from this study pertaining to the state of the diffusion of artificial intelligence through the adoption and implementation process. The findings indicated that school leaders were actively engaged in conversations related to AI adoption and implementation. They also created structures (organizational) to ensure the successful adoption and implementation of artificial intelligence. Originality/value: This is an original study that examined the experiences of school leaders who have adopted and implemented artificial intelligence in their schools. The body of literature related to artificial intelligence and school leadership is extremely limited.",
