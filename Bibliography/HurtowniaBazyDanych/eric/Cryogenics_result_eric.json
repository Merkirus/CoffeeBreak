        "description":"This study explores the impact of a cryogenics-based enrichment programme, which involves demonstrations that use liquid nitrogen, on attitudes towards science and the learning of science concepts. The findings presented in this paper are based on a sample of 214 fifth-grade students from two schools in Singapore who had their enrichment lesson in a subzero-temperature science centre. Overall, the students viewed science as more enjoyable and acquired more interest in wanting to pursue science careers after experiencing the cryogenics-based enrichment programme, but no remarkable and conclusive change was detected in their perceptions of the social implications of science. Significant knowledge gains were also detected among the participants. The programme did not have any differential impact on students of either gender and from two learning streams, both cognitively and affectively.",

        "description":"Concepts learned in the classroom were reinforced and augmented by presenting them in a different context using cryogenics-based enrichment programmes (CBEPs) held in an out-of-school setting. The effectiveness of two CBEPs, which involve the use of liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen, was explored. Using a sample of 265 upper primary students, it was found that both enrichment programmes were effective in promoting the learning of science concepts. Fair improvements, albeit only transient, in two attitude constructs, enjoyment of science and career preference, due to either CBEPs were detected. The CBEPs did not have any significant impact on the attitude construct relating to students' views on the social implications of science. The impact of CBEPs showed signs of retention, specifically in the cognitive realm, and reasonable indications of influencing subsequent learning and activities of students.",

        "description":"The key way for government to legislate the scientific revolution is to know when science threatens to ethically destroy the fabric of society. The U.S. President has asked you (the student), his senior advisor, to test the waters of this new science and evaluate what stance he needs to take regarding issues like cloning, cryogenics, assisted suicide, etc. To stay in office, the President must define his beliefs and find a way to mesh them with those of the public. This lesson plan calls for the student (the senior advisor) and his staff (group) to gather the scientific information necessary to advise the President, taking into account scientists like Galileo and Edward Jenner, both viewed initially with skepticism, but winning out against considerable odds. The lesson plan  suggests a focus on five questions relating to Galileo and Jenner. It describes the process; lists resources; gives learning advice; considers evaluation; and provides concluding questions. The teacher notes section gives a grade level and a lesson purpose; addresses history/social science and language arts standards; and suggests length of lesson and adaptations for special needs students.
