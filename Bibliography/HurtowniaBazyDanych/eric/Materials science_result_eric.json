        "description":"This resource guide is a source of current information for teachers, principals, administrators, science curriculum specialists, parents, and those involved in systemic reform of science education. These curriculum materials and other resources support inquiry-based science teaching that fosters an understanding of science concepts through hands-on student investigations. After a brief introduction, part 2, Elementary School Science Curriculum Materials, contains 350 individual entries that list and annotate curriculum materials in life science, Earth science, physical science, and multidisciplinary and applied science. The annotations are further divided into core materials, supplementary materials, and science activity books. This section also contains information on major  funded projects in hands-on elementary science over the years dating back to the late 1960s. Part 3, Teacher's References, has annotations of books on teaching science, science book lists and resource guides, and periodicals. Part 4, Ancillary Resources for Elementary Science Teachers, contains two chapters that focus on facilities, associations, and federal and other organizations that have programs, services, and materials relevant to some aspect of hands-on, inquiry-based elementary science education. Appendices include publishers and suppliers and evaluation criteria for curriculum materials. (JRH)",
