        "description":"The present study examined undergraduate psychology students' (N = 83) self-reported interest in and familiarity with five specialty areas in professional psychology: counseling psychology, clinical psychology, school psychology, forensic psychology, and criminal profiling. Results suggest that although students are quite interested in careers that combine psychology and law, their level of familiarity with such careers falls short of their interest level. Based on these findings, psychology programs should consider providing more information to students about careers in professional psychology, particularly regarding careers that combine psychology and law.

Research into the representation of other sub-fields of psychology has been conducted but no research has looked specifically at educational or school psychology. The second goal was to compare the representation of educational and school psychology in introductory psychology textbooks to see if one or the other is receiving more coverage. Third, the textbooks with the most coverage were listed in order to aid educational and school psychologists teaching introductory psychology courses in selecting textbooks that adequately cover material from their sub-fields. A total of 57 introductory psychology textbooks were content analyzed: 65% of the introductory psychology textbooks had educational psychology material and 65% had school psychology material. However, in the textbooks containing this material the educational and school psychology material made up only .29% and .19% of the textbooks total content.",

Unfortunately, the discipline of school psychology appears to receive at best only cursory coverage in undergraduate psychology texts, curriculum, and discussion by psychology department faculty even though school psychology has an ongoing critical shortage of academicians and practitioners. This study examined attitudes and preferences for choosing graduate training in psychology in general and school psychology in a sample of undergraduate psychology students. Several factors emerged as significant, including one&apos;s attitude toward research, child-related interests, and geographic constraints.

        "description":"In a general sense, psychology is a science that studies human and animal behaviours, and the reasons of these behaviours. The symbolic foundation date of psychology is 1879. In this year, Wilheml Wundt (1832-1920) established a psychology laboratory in Leipzig. Psychology is accepted to have started as a science with the establishment of this psychology laboratory. From the point that started with Wilhelm Wundt and his colleagues on, the period of consciousness has mostly been investigated through the method of introspection and the conscious of human has been tried to be analyzed (Otrar, Eminoglu Küçüktepe, Küçüktepe, 2010). Psychology is a branch of science that aims at examining the interaction between environment, human being and behaviour. This branch of science is divided into sub-fields such as experimental psychology, social psychology, psychometric psychology and applied psychology. [image omitted] There are a lot of sub-branches under applied psychology. One of them is educational psychology. Educational psychology is about implementing the findings of psychology in the field of education. Educational psychology mainly composes two sub-fields. These are developmental psychology and psychology of learning. Developmental psychology is a field of psychology that examines the physical, psychological, cognitive and behavioral changes of a person from the birth to the death. Developmental psychology is one of the basic fields from which educational psychology benefits; because being aware of the developmental features of students' ages ensures an increase in the efficiency of educational period.",

Most school psychology trainers do not teach at the undergraduate level, thus undergraduate psychology students may not be adequately exposed to school psychology during undergraduate training. Research suggests that increased knowledge and exposure to school psychology are associated with increased intentions for school psychology. In the current study, 55 undergraduate students completed measures of knowledge, exposure, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and choice intentions at the beginning and end of professional psychology courses. Results indicated that students enrolled in undergraduate psychology courses did not demonstrate significant increases in the aforementioned areas for school psychology. Efforts such as creating school psychology-specific courses or infusing material should be made to increase the representation of school psychology in undergraduate psychology curricula.",

        "description":"No individual in the early history of American psychology is more identified with the promotion of applied psychology than Hugo Munsterberg, whose books and articles on applied topics such as industrial psychology, forensic psychology, psychotherapy, and educational psychology made him one of the most visible psychologists of his day. But there is an earlier chapter to Munsterberg's life that tells a very different story of a Munsterberg opposed to application. The story begins in 1898 when he wrote an article for an American magazine in which he told teachers that the findings of experimental psychology had no relevance for education, setting off a firestorm of controversy among his colleagues in psychology and education. This article describes Munsterberg's early denigration of applied psychology and his subsequent transformation as applied psychologist. Reasons for that transformation are discussed as well as issues involving the stigma associated with applied psychology and the popularization of psychology.",

        "description":"Trainers within school psychology have struggled to recruit racial/ethnic minority graduate students, with a recent demographic survey suggesting that racial/ethnic minorities comprise 9.3% of school-based practitioners (Curtis, Castillo, &amp; Gelley, 2012). Furthermore, research has suggested that school psychology training programs have also lagged behind counseling and clinical psychology in the recruitment of minority students (Fiegener, 2009). In the current study, 782 junior and senior undergraduate psychology students, representing the four regions of the USA, were included in an online study. Students&apos; knowledge and exposure were compared across school, counseling, and clinical psychology. Students&apos; intentions for applying to a school psychology program were also assessed. Results suggest that students have less knowledge and exposure to school psychology compared to counseling or clinical psychology and that students with greater knowledge or exposure for school psychology have stronger intentions of applying to a school psychology graduate program. No significant difference was found between minority and non-minority students&apos; knowledge or exposure to school psychology. Implications for minority and non-minority recruitment are discussed.",

        "description":"This paper argues for community psychology to be included within the discipline boundaries of psychology. In doing this, it will enable psychology to begin to address some of the large scale social issues affecting people's well-being. It will be necessary, however, to incorporate aspects of other disciplines, make explicit the political dimensions of psychological knowledge and practice, and adopt an action-oriented, more student-centred approach to learning. The paper will draw on student experiences to illustrate the value of community psychology learning. Radford (2008) raised a number of issues challenging the boundaries of the discipline of psychology and the relevance of an education in psychology as overseen by the British Psychological Society. In this paper, Kagan will further the case for a psychology that addresses real world issues and goes beyond its current boundaries. In doing this, she will explore the extent to which community psychology is contained within the boundary of psychology, the challenges that an emergent community psychology might make to the parent discipline, and the benefits to students of community based learning of community psychology.",

        "description":"The purpose of the present study was to identify the core references in introductory textbooks in two sub-disciplines of psychology: social psychology and developmental psychology. One research question was the extent to which the common references in these textbooks present the trends in contemporary research in each sub-discipline. An analysis of the reference sections of 10 introductory social psychology textbooks and 15 developmental psychology textbooks found a small set of common references for each subject area. The results yielded three additional effects. First, there were more common references across social psychology textbooks than across developmental psychology textbooks. Second, authors of social psychology textbooks used journal articles as common references more often than books, whereas authors of developmental psychology textbooks used books as common references more than journal articles. Third, the majority of the core references were published prior to 2000. Implications of these findings for teachers of psychology were discussed.",
