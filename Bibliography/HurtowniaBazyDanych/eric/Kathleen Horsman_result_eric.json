The sourcebook consists of three chapters that all contain an introduction, tools for programs, and examples from programs. The topics examined in the three chapters are as follows: (1) taking on the challenge of helping women who have felt the impacts of violence (reasons for addressing violence; exploring the complexities of violence; recognizing violence's impacts on learning); (2) building a web of support for learners who have been impacted by violence (building program support; building community support; practicing self-care); and (3) reforming programming  (acknowledging violence; creating conditions for learning; changing the curriculum). The following resource materials are included: (1) the article &quot;But I'm Not a Therapist: The Challenge of Creating Effective Literacy Learning for Survivors of Trauma&quot; (Jenny Horsman, Sue Shore); (2) a step-by-step description of the collage process; (3) materials about and from a playwriting project in a native language literacy group; (4) examples of poems used by programs; (5) sample materials on violence in public space; and (5) bibliographies listing a total of 121 references.

        "description":"This article draws on three Canadian research studies to question conventional understandings that access to adult literacy education is a simple matter of providing programs. In the face of women's experiences of violence, commonly overlooked barriers limit ''access.'' Different forms of violence, their frequency, and the prevalence of medicalizing discourses about violence are examined. Effects of violence on women's attempts to get to programs, complete courses they begin, and learn successfully, are introduced. Educators are challenged to design literacy programs that will support learning and create conditions to counteract the early ''training'' which tells women they cannot learn.",

        "description":"Recent Canadian university student misbehaviour (rape chants, harassment, sexual assault, and anti-social media posts) has garnered much attention in the media and from university administrations. Most research concerned to address these issues focuses on sexual attitudes, gender, and party culture. In this study, we analyse student interviews from a narrative perspective and find that students use storytelling devices to construct a gendered, but also class-based, division of self into two parts: university life that &quot;does not count&quot; and post-university life that &quot;counts&quot; in terms of choices and actions. We called this construction a &quot;meaningful meaninglessness&quot;. We conclude with a consideration of the meaning of the university in general and how current trends in education may contribute to student alienation.",

        "description":"This paper is intended as a discussion paper to open up talk in the literacy community on how literacy programs can account for the impact violence has on learning. It builds on the author's previous research on issues raised by literacy workers, educators, researchers, academics, therapists, and counselors concerning this impact. The current study is seeking to better understand what supports and what hinders making change in literacy programs so that the programs can more fully support learning for all women, and in particular those who have experienced violence. In this paper the author tries to reveal the processes of &quot;dominant discourses&quot; that exclude the issue of violence from education, thus making change unlikely. Seeing language and current practices as discourse offers  a tool to get outside a focus on what is right and draw attention to examining how certain discourses open and close possibilities.

Interviews were conducted with literacy workers, learners, and counselors to determine the impact of abuse they saw in their work and how literacy programs could address the impact of violence. Following an introduction there is a section that discusses violence and trauma. The next section covers the issues of control, connection, and meaning and how they can be incorporated into a literacy program. The connections between literacy and therapy are then explored. Next an examination is made of new possibilities for literacy practice in light of the impact that  violence can have on learning. The last section discusses how to create balance among mind, body, emotion, and spirit through literacy programs. All of these sections are followed by a list of possible actions that can be taken by literacy programs and organizations. (ADT)",

        "description":"Three-dimensional spatial visualization is an essential skill for geoscientists. We conducted two evaluations of students' spatial skills to examine whether their skills improve after enrollment in a geology course or courses. First, we present results of pre- and post-course survey of abstract visualization skills used to characterize the range of spatial abilities in the student population at Carleton College. In Introductory Geology, there was a correlation between those who score very poorly on the spatial survey and those who receive a grade of C or lower. Students in higher-level courses had better developed visualization skills than those in Introductory Geology. Gender differences disappeared in upper-level courses except for the spatial relations (mental rotation) task, where male students consistently outperformed females. Second, we describe the efficacy of instructional materials designed for a Structural Geology course at the University of Wisconsin. This study included a qualitative controlled experiment investigating whether frequent use of stereographic projections affected student performance on exam questions requiring spatial skills. The results of both the survey-based quantitative study and materials-based qualitative study suggest that students' spatial abilities can improve through practice provided in geology courses.",

        "description":"In Saskatchewan, a growing number of schools contain split-grade or multi-grade classrooms. This resource is designed to help teachers develop a vision of how successful teaching and learning can occur in multi-level classrooms. It provides teachers with practical applications that support an environment that is learner-centered. The first four sections define multi-level classrooms; discuss the keys to teaching success; address opportunities and challenges; and look at the classroom as a community of learners. The last sections focus on curriculum and instruction, timetabling, and assessment. The section on curriculum and instruction discusses curriculum mapping, thematic teaching, independent study, peer tutoring, experiential learning, and other topics. It also examines  effective ways to ensure that students achieve objectives in required areas of study. Goals for English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, arts education, physical education, and health are presented. Continuous, ongoing assessment is essential in any classroom. Techniques that are representative ways to conduct effective evaluation and assessment in a multi-level classroom are summarized. Approaches to authentic assessment are also discussed, including the use of rubrics. Practical examples are included in each section. Multi-level resources available from the Stewart Resources Centre in Saskatoon are listed. (Contains 32 references.) (CDS)",
