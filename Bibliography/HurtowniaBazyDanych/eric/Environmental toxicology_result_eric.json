        "description":"Developmental models currently used by child behavioral toxicologists and teratologists are inadequate to address current issues in these fields. Both child behavioral teratology and toxicology scientifically study the impact of exposure to toxic agents on behavior development: teratology focuses on prenatal exposure and postnatal behavior development; toxicology on postnatal exposure and subsequent behavioral development. In general, the field of behavioral toxicology has underestimated, dismissed, or poorly evaluated the potential impact of psychosocial variables in determining an infant's or child's vulnerability to toxicants. Given the complexity of developmental processes, behavioral toxicologists and teratologists must adopt developmental models more complex than the &quot;main  effects&quot; model currently in use. The more realistic interactive model, while better than the main effects model, is also inadequate since its elements are essentially static. Developmental toxicology must adopt a transactional model, or one that takes into account the ongoing transactions between individual biological and behavioral factors and the environmental contexts in which they operate. (An outline of a test battery formulated to link lead exposure to developmental delays is discussed in terms of five aspects that make it capable of addressing issues generated by the transactional model as applied to child behavioral toxicology.)

Modifications of a vertebrate developmental toxicity assay using the frog Xenopus laevis can support student-initiated toxicology experiments that are relevant to humans. Teams of students formulate hypotheses, perform experiments, analyze data, and present their results. By performing experiments to investigate the toxicity of household chemicals, pharmaceuticals, or agricultural chemicals, students will gain an appreciation of the environmental effects of improper disposal of common chemicals and industrial or agricultural run-off.",

This study reports on 47 students' self-reported experiences with the course outcomes and their opinions of the CURE project. Students in both courses increased their levels of experience in skills related to the CURE project, including their ability to design a project where the outcome was unknown. Further, most students felt a sense of project ownership, but their ownership was attributed only to the positive aspects of the CURE. At the end of the CURE, the students in both classes demonstrated the ability to connect ideas and techniques learned in the course to a broader environmental research question. We also suggest several tips for developing collaborative CUREs in undergraduate courses.",
