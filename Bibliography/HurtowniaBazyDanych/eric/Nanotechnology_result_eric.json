        "description":"Background: In this era of rapid technical advancement, there are growing debates around the idea of nanotechnology, which are both timely and controversial. Nanotechnology materials are being utilized in our daily lives in many ways, often without consumer knowledge. Due to the explosion of nanotechnology applications, there is a necessity to update school science curricula by integrating nanotechnology-related concepts that are both relevant and meaningful to students. The integration of nanotechnology in school science curricula comes in response to nanoscientific development and our mission as educators to instill and arouse students' curiosity in learning about both what is and what will be more dominantly occupying the marketplace. Purpose: The purpose of this review was to set a baseline for the current work being conducted in moving nanotechnology-based activities into the school science setting. Design and methods: The review was implemented by searching LexisNexis Academic, EBSCOhost, Academic Search Complete, Education Search Complete as well as Google Scholar using search terms of nanotechnology, nanotechnology in schools, nanotechnology activities, history of nanotechnology, implications of nanotechnology, issues of nanotechnology and related combinations with nanotechnology as a consistent keyword. Returned articles were categorized by thematic content with primary and seminal work being given priority for inclusion. Conclusions: Current literature in the area of nanotechnology integration into school science curricula presented seven key categories of discussion: the origins of nanotechnology, challenges for educational implementation, currently available school activities, current consumer product applications, ethical issues, recommendations for educational policy, and implications of nanotechnology. There is limited availability of school-based activities. There are strong proponents for including nanotechnology in school science curricula. However, barriers to that inclusion are both real and perceived and are consistent with barriers reported for including other new science topics in the curricula, such as time, curricular and cognitive overload, and inclusion on assessment.",

        "description":"There is a great need for professionals trained to work in the field of nanotechnology, particularly in food and agriculture. However, the general public knows very little about nanotechnology; therefore, few students entering college seek out educational opportunities that will lead to careers with a focus on nanotechnology. This study was conducted to determine whether typical first-year seminar activities, including lectures, readings, and hands-on demonstrations, impact students' perception and interest in the study of nanotechnology. In fall 2004, 514 first-year food and agriculture students at Purdue University were briefly exposed to nanotechnology through two 50-minute nanotechnology seminars and a related reading. Eighteen of these students also participated in nanotechnology-based, hands-on activities. A Nanotechnology Awareness Survey (measuring exposure, awareness, motivation, and knowledge) was administered before and after this brief nanotechnology exposure. Participants in the hands-on activities responded to open-ended questions about their motivations to pursue education and careers in nanotechnology. Analysis of 335 survey responses indicates that students show significant increases in nanotechnology exposure and awareness after the brief nanotechnology exposure. Students also showed significant increases in knowledge from pre- to post-survey. However, motivation was not affected, though a larger fraction of the hands-on demonstration participants expressed motivation to pursue a nanotechnology-related educational or career path. Typical first-year seminar activities appear to be sufficient to raise students' awareness and knowledge of nanotechnology. However, these activities, at least in the short term, are not sufficient to raise students' motivation to pursue further educational or career opportunities in nanotechnology.

The study found that most students learned the term \"nano\" from popular science magazines or as a measurement unit; less than 5% of the students learned \"nano\" through nanotechnology education. The study also showed the students' obvious optimism on nanotechnology but lack of deep understanding and commitment to \"nano.\" Among the students studied, female students were more enthusiastic in learning and participating in nanotechnology, but they were more likely to accept false nano-knowledge. The study showed that there is a clear need to understand the students' personal views on many nanotechnology issues before technical issues can be properly addressed.

        "description":"Nanotechnology will be among the most needed workforce areas in the near future. It is also a creative and highly dynamic field of innovative research areas that displays numerous open fields for future graduates. The central thesis of this paper is to better understand undergraduate engineering students' awareness, exposure, and motivation towards nanotechnology, how those constructs correlate with each other, and whether there are differences by gender or year of study. This exploratory study used mixed methods to answer the research question. Results revealed that engineering students have more motivation to pursue further nanotechnology knowledge or study than they have exposure or awareness about nanotechnology. The results showed that male students have more awareness about nanotechnology than female students. Educational implications are that it is necessary to provide students with more opportunities to learn about and study nanotechnology during their undergraduate experience. While students are interested in learning more, their current levels of awareness and exposure may hold them back in pursuing nanotechnology-related careers.",

        "description":"In recent years nanotechnology has become part of the content of many undergraduate chemistry and physics degree courses. This paper deals with the role of contextualisation of nanotechnology in the delivery of the content, as nanotechnology is only now being slowly integrated into many chemistry degree courses in Ireland and elsewhere. An evaluative methodology of the pedagogical approach for two introductory nanotechnology courses has been chosen for this study. Pre and post-course testing at 2nd year level (Case study A) and 4th year level (Case study B) has been carried out, 80 % of students in case study A and 64 % in case study B felt that they had little or no prior knowledge of nanotechnology before the courses were delivered. The students were very interested in learning about nanotechnology and enjoyed its futuristic concepts. They recognised that nanotechnology is an enabling technology, and when surveyed, considered the biomedical applications of most interest. (Contains 3 tables and 5 figures.)",

        "author":["Lan, Yu-Ling"],
        "description":"To maximize the contributions of nanotechnology to this society, at least 60 countries have put efforts into this field. In Taiwan, a government-funded K-12 Nanotechnology Programme was established to train K-12 teachers with adequate nanotechnology literacy to foster the next generation of Taiwanese people with sufficient knowledge in nanotechnology. In the present study, the Nanotechnology Attitude Scale for K-12 teachers (NAS-T) was developed to assess K-12 teachers' attitudes toward nanotechnology. The NAS-T included 23 Likert-scale items that can be grouped into three components: importance of nanotechnology, affective tendencies in science teaching, and behavioural tendencies to teach nanotechnology. A sample of 233 K-12 teachers who have participated in the K-12 Nanotechnology Programme was included in the present study to investigate the psychometric properties of the NAS-T. The exploratory factor analysis of this teacher sample suggested that the NAS-T was a three-factor model that explained 64.11% of the total variances. This model was also confirmed by the confirmatory factor analysis to validate the factor structure of the NAS-T. The Cronbach's alpha values of three NAS-T subscales ranged from 0.89 to 0.95. Moderate to strong correlations among teachers' NAS-T domain scores, self-perception of own nanoscience knowledge, and their science-teaching efficacy demonstrated good convergent validity of the NAS-T. As a whole, psychometric properties of the NAS-T indicated that this instrument is an effective instrument for assessing K-12 teachers' attitudes toward nanotechnology. The NAS-T will serve as a valuable tool to evaluate teachers' attitude changes after participating in the K-12 Nanotechnology Programme. (Contains 4 tables, 2 figures and 2 notes.)",

        "description":"The revolutionary Feynman vision of a powerful and general nanotechnology, based on nanomachines that build with atom-by-atom control, promises great opportunities and, if abused, great dangers. This vision made nanotechnology a buzzword and launched the global nanotechnology race. Along the way, however, the meaning of the word has shifted. A vastly broadened definition of nanotechnology (including any technology with nanoscale features) enabled specialists from diverse fields to infuse unrelated research with the Feynman mystique. The resulting nanoscale technology funding coalition has obscured the Feynman vision by misunderstanding its basis, distrusting its promise, and fearing that public concern regarding its dangers might interfere with research funding. In response, leaders of a funding coalition have attempted to narrow nanotechnology to exclude one area of nanoscale technology--the Feynman vision itself. Their misdirected arguments against the Feynman vision have needlessly confused public discussion of the objectives and consequences of nanotechnology research.",

In this article, the authors question this conclusion, pointing out that the predicted concrete ethical issues related to the area of nanotechnology are rather similar to those related to the area of biotechnology and biology that have been considered by ethicists since the 1970s. Hence, a knowledge base has already been acquired from ethical reflections on biotechnology and biology, which may be a good starting point and foundation for a discussion of ethical reflections on nanotechnology. The authors argue that a promising approach is the use of basic ethical principles as a method to analyze ethical issues of nanotechnology. (Contains 2 tables, 1 figure and 5 notes.)",

However, there is no instrument to assess the impact of these interventions on student awareness of, exposure to, and motivation for nanotechnology. To address this need, the \"Nanotechnology Awareness Instrument\" was conceptualized. This paper is a progress report of the instrument development process. Version 1 of the instrument was administered to 335 first-year students majoring in food and agriculture fields in a pre-post fashion relative to a brief exposure to nanotechnology in the classroom. Following item analysis of Version 1 responses, a revision of the instrument was completed. Version 2 was administered to 1,426 first-year engineering students for the purpose of conducting item and factor analyses. Results indicate that the \"Nanotechnology Awareness Instrument\" shows potential to provide valid information about student awareness of, exposure to, and motivation for nanotechnology. The instrument is not a valid measure of nano-knowledge and this subscale was dropped from the final version of the instrument. Implications include the use of the instrument to evaluate programs, interventions, or courses that attempt to increase student awareness of nanotechnology. Further study is necessary to determine how the \"Nanotechnology Awareness Instrument\" functions as a pre-post measure.",

        "description":"Background: Nanotechnology education has become an urgent priority to nurture skilled human resources for the rapidly developing nanotechnology-related industries. The promotion of popular science education focusing on nanotechnology is an ideal approach to bridge the gaps in formal curricula, and to stimulate curiosity about and interest in nanotechnology among schoolchildren. Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Nanotechnology-based Popular Science Education Promotion and Teaching (NPSEPT) program through camp activity that was implemented in elementary schools in I-Lan City, Taiwan. Program description: To create a competitive advantage, a human resources development program was implemented as one of the nanotechnology incubation projects in Taiwan and focused on developing an appropriately-skilled professional workforce as well as promoting popular science education. Sample: The volunteer research participants were 323 sixth grade students in four elementary schools in I-Lan City, Taiwan, who were evaluated at the beginning and the end of the nanotechnology-based popular science promotion camp activity. Design and methods: A research tool called the &quot;NPSEPT test&quot; was designed specifically for this study and was approved by experts who evaluated its content and face validity. The questionnaire was divided into three aspects: &quot;Nanophenomena in the natural world&quot;; &quot;Nanomaterials and their scaling effects&quot;; and &quot;Definition, characteristics, and applications of nanotechnology.&quot; The effectiveness of learning among the students was analyzed using descriptive statistics, a paired sample t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc comparison. Results: The results of the three-part &quot;NPSEPT test&quot; revealed that NPSEPT significantly advanced nanotechnology learning performance and outcomes among students in the four participating elementary schools. Of the 15 questions included in the NPSEPT test, positive change for more than 30% of students was achieved for eight questions related to nanotechnology concepts. Conclusions: Significant effectiveness of the NPSEPT program and nanotechnology learning outcomes of the elementary school students were observed. The NPSEPT program should therefore be considered an appropriate program to promote popular science with a focus on nanotechnology in elementary schools.",

        "description":"Nanotechnology has made a huge impact on science, technology, and society. At the same time, educational institutions at all levels have recognized its relevance and introduced courses that aim at familiarizing their students with the basic concepts of nanotechnology. While the importance of teaching nanotechnology, the contents of such courses, and insightful activities in the laboratory have received a lot of attention, the classroom activities that help students grasp the concepts of nanotechnology have been rather underrepresented, especially in higher education. Here, we describe a student activity that focuses on a research proposal as part of a third-year undergraduate nanotechnology course for chemistry majors. Students work in pairs to review a relevant and contemporary topic in nanotechnology and to propose and develop an original research idea. This is presented and defended in the form of an oral presentation before an audience of peers and is written using an article template. The aim of the described approach is to not only help students learn about nanotechnology in a fun and active manner but also to stimulate critical scientific thinking in students as well as to foster the development of their academic, professional, and soft skills. In line with this, the assessment of students relies on the assessment of the oral presentation, engagement in discussion, and the written research proposal.",

        "description":"Nanotechnology is an emerging technology, and it is regarded as the basis for the next industrial revolution. In developing countries, nanotechnology promises to solve everyday challenges, such as the provision of potable water, reliable energy sources and effective medication. However, there are several challenges in the exploitation of nanotechnology. One of the notable challenges is the lack of adequate knowledge about how materials behave at the nanoscale. As nanotechnology is relatively new, the current generation of scientists have not had the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of the technology at an early stage. Young students who are at the primary school level may follow the same trajectory if they are not exposed to the technology. There is a need to lay a strong foundation by introducing nanoscience and nanotechnology to students at the primary school level. It is during the early stages of child development that students master basic concepts for life long learning. Nevertheless, many primary school children, particularly those in developing countries are missing the chance of learning about nanoscience and nanotechnology because it is regarded as being abstract and complex. In this paper, we argue that despite the complexity of nanoscience and nanotechnology, science centres can be used as one of the platforms for exposing young students to the discipline. We use a case study of a museum-based science centre as an example to illustrate that young students can be exposed to nanoscience and nanotechnology using tactile and hands-on experience. The early engagement of primary school children with nanoscience and nanotechnology is important in raising the next generation of scientists who are firmly grounded in the discipline.",

After training, the students debated a Socially Acute Question (SAQ) that they elaborated during the various phases of instruction. The field of SAQs represents a French orientation for the teaching of SocioScientific Issues. We analyzed the interactions of students in the debate to determine their risk perception on nanotechnology. We compared and put their arguments into perspective using various analytical frameworks. We observed two contrasting argumentative tendencies: one reflecting a positivist view that involved an individualistic use of nanotechnology and science and one carrying a critical and humanistic vision of the use of nanotechnology and science.",

The aim of this study is to determine awareness, exposure, and knowledge levels of science (physics, chemistry and biology) teachers about nanoscience and nanotechnology. Teachers (N=624) from secondary schools in Turkey comprised the working group. Descriptive methods were used in data analyses. Awareness and exposure subscales were adopted from the &quot;Nanotechnology Awareness Instrument&quot; developed by Dyehouse et al. (2008), and the knowledge subscale, developed by the authors, was added to the Turkish version. Differences among or between the teachers' awareness, exposure, and knowledge levels regarding nanoscience and nanotechnology were determined. No significant differences were found in levels of awareness, exposure, and knowledge of teachers in terms of subject specialisation and educational levels; however, some significant differences were found in gender, tenure, grade and type of school, in-service training participation, following scientific publications, documentary watching frequency and school localisation variables. In general, nanoscience and nanotechnology awareness, exposure, and knowledge levels of the teachers were at a &quot;neutral&quot; level. This study shows needs for further training of science teachers in nanoscience and nanotechnology, to increase their level of awareness and knowledge and to ensure their preparedness for teaching this topic.",

The history of nanotechnology development and the current advances in this emerging field are discussed in the context of workforce development and the challenges it poses to human resource development (HRD) professionals. Concerned with the lack of educators and educational policy experts in the dialogue on nanotechnology and the need for multi-, trans-, and inter-disciplinary employability skills curricula for nanotechnology, this article argues for a different approach to VET that endorses the democratic ideals proposed by Dewey, in preparing students for challenges in nanotechnology careers. The article argues that the multi-, trans-, and inter-disciplinary nature of nanotechnology require that nanoVET should be guided by history and be modeled within the comprehensive democratic approach advanced by Dewey. The article concludes with a discussion on the implications for HRD practice, research, and theory.",

This manuscript focuses on undergraduate engineering students' perceptions of the risks and benefits posed by nanotechnology as an important component of scientific literacy. Specifically, this study examined the perceived risk of nanotechnology of a group of American students (N = 102) in three material science engineering courses focusing on nanotechnology. Students completed a survey of risk perception and a sub-sample were interviewed (n = 21). It was found that perceptions of risks and benefits of nanotechnology tended to be closely tied to specific groups of applications including common consumer products, health-related products, and advanced technological applications. The intersection of scientific application and perception is discussed in the context of science education curriculum considerations. (Contains 4 tables.)",
