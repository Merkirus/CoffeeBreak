        "description":"We developed and validated a conceptual survey that focuses on the formalism and postulates of quantum mechanics covered in upper-level undergraduate quantum mechanics courses. The concepts included in the quantum mechanics formalism and postulate survey (QMFPS) focus on Dirac notation, the Hilbert space, state vectors, physical observables and their corresponding Hermitian operators, compatible and incompatible observables, quantum measurement, time dependence of quantum states and expectation values, and spin angular momenta. Here we describe the validation and administration of the survey, which has been administered to over 400 upper-level undergraduate and graduate students from six institutions. The QMFPS is valid and reliable for use as a low-stakes test to measure the effectiveness of instruction in an undergraduate quantum mechanics course that covers relevant content. The survey can also be used by instructors to identify students' understanding of the formalism and postulates of quantum mechanics at the beginning and end of a graduate quantum mechanics course since graduate students are expected to have taken an undergraduate quantum mechanics course that covers the content included in the survey. We found that undergraduate students who engaged with research-validated learning tools performed better than students who did not on the QMFPS after the first semester of a junior or senior level quantum mechanics course. In addition, the performance of graduate students on QMFPS after instruction in the first semester of a core graduate-level quantum mechanics course was significantly better than the performance of undergraduate students at the end of the first semester of an undergraduate quantum mechanics course. However, both undergraduate and graduate students struggled with many questions on the QMFPS. A comparison with the base line data on the validated QMFPS presented here can aid instructors in assessing the effectiveness of their instructional approaches and help them identify the difficulties their students have with quantum formalism and postulates in order to help students develop a solid grasp of the formalism and postulates of quantum mechanics.",

        "description":"Quantum mechanics has proven to be a challenging subject for instructors to teach and conceptually difficult for students to understand. A major source of the difficulty is the lack of everyday experience that quantum mechanics can be related to and the change in thinking required in transitioning from deterministic classical mechanics to a probabilistic quantum theory. Philosophically, the transition has been difficult to reconcile even amongst the physics community. Despite this, the epistemological and ontological underpinnings of instruction in quantum mechanics have not been well documented. In this paper, the philosophical commitments of two popular textbooks that are a staple in undergraduate and graduate classrooms around the world are analyzed to examine their interpretative and philosophical grounding. The textbooks are analyzed from the perspective of a student encountering quantum mechanics for the first time and are related to the well documented problems students face in trying to understand quantum mechanics. Recommendations for future textbooks are also made along with a call to enable students to engage in meaningful discourse and debate over the meanings of quantum mechanical systems.",

        "description":"Superposition gives rise to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and is therefore one of the concepts at the heart of quantum mechanics. Although we have found that many students can successfully use the idea of superposition to calculate the probabilities of different measurement outcomes, they are often unable to identify the experimental implications of a superposition state. In particular, they fail to recognize how a superposition state and a mixed state (sometimes called a &quot;lack of knowledge&quot; state) can produce different experimental results. We present data that suggest that superposition in quantum mechanics is a difficult concept for students enrolled in sophomore-, junior-, and graduate-level quantum mechanics courses. We illustrate how an interactive lecture tutorial can improve student understanding of quantum mechanical superposition. A longitudinal study suggests that the impact persists after an additional quarter of quantum mechanics instruction that does not specifically address these ideas.",

        "description":"Learning advanced physics, in general, is challenging not only due to the increased mathematical sophistication but also because one must continue to build on all of the prior knowledge acquired at the introductory and intermediate levels. In addition, learning quantum mechanics can be especially challenging because the paradigms of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics are very different. Here, we review research on student reasoning difficulties in learning upper-level quantum mechanics and research on students' problem-solving and metacognitive skills in these courses. Some of these studies were multiuniversity investigations. The investigations suggest that there is large diversity in student performance in upper-level quantum mechanics regardless of the university, textbook, or instructor, and many students in these courses have not acquired a functional understanding of the fundamental concepts. The nature of reasoning difficulties in learning quantum mechanics is analogous to reasoning difficulties found via research in introductory physics courses. The reasoning difficulties were often due to overgeneralizations of concepts learned in one context to another context where they are not directly applicable. Reasoning difficulties in distinguishing between closely related concepts and in making sense of the formalism of quantum mechanics were common. We conclude with a brief summary of the research-based approaches that take advantage of research on student difficulties in order to improve teaching and learning of quantum mechanics.

        "description":"Quantum numbers and electron configurations form an important part of the general chemistry curriculum and textbooks. The objectives of this study are: (1) Elaboration of a framework based on the following aspects: (a) Origin of the quantum hypothesis, (b) Alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics, (c) Differentiation between an orbital and electron density, (d) Differentiation and comparison between classical and quantum mechanics, and (e) Introduction of quantum numbers based on electron density; (2) Formulation of five criteria based on the different aspects (a, b, c, d, and e), and (3) Evaluation of 55 freshman college-level general chemistry textbooks. Results obtained show: Criterion 1, none of the textbooks described satisfactorily that Planck's role in the origin of the quantum hypothesis was more at the level of an empirical adjustment, whereas Einstein provided the physical significance of the quantum hypothesis; Criterion 2, few textbooks (two satisfactory and four mentioned) included alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics (e.g., Bohm) and thus ignored that most theories are underdetermined by experimental evidence; Criterion 3, none of the textbooks described satisfactorily that orbitals are mathematical constructs and the shapes of the orbitals (\"s\", \"p\", \"d\", \"f\") are not derived from quantum mechanics but instead from electron density measurements; Criterion 4, although, quantum mechanics approaches classical mechanics as a limiting case, none of the textbooks presented a framework to facilitate transition in student understanding from classical to quantum mechanics (28 textbooks made a simple mention); and Criterion 5, few textbooks (one satisfactory, five mentioned) facilitated the introduction of quantum numbers based on experimental determination of electron density (photoelectron spectrum). It is concluded that the inclusion of these criteria in textbooks can facilitate students' conceptual understanding of quantum numbers and electron configurations.

A conceptual approach to quantum mechanics is being implemented in more and more introductory physics courses around the world. Because of the differences between the conceptual nature of quantum mechanics and classical physics, research on misconceptions, testing, and teaching strategies for introductory quantum mechanics is needed. For this review, 74 articles were selected and analyzed for the misconceptions, research tools, teaching strategies, and multimedia applications investigated. Outcomes were categorized according to their contribution to the various subtopics of quantum mechanics. Analysis shows that students have difficulty relating quantum physics to physical reality. It also shows that the teaching of complex quantum behavior, such as time dependence, superposition, and the measurement problem, has barely been investigated for the secondary and lower undergraduate level. At the secondary school level, this article shows a need to investigate student difficulties concerning wave functions and potential wells. Investigation of research tools shows the necessity for the development of assessment tools for secondary and lower undergraduate education, which cover all major topics and are suitable for statistical analysis. Furthermore, this article shows the existence of very diverse ideas concerning teaching strategies for quantum mechanics and a lack of research into which strategies promote understanding. This article underlines the need for more empirical research into student difficulties, teaching strategies, activities, and research tools intended for a conceptual approach for quantum mechanics.",

Specifically introducing quantum mechanics as a solution to the arcane dilemma, the ultraviolet catastrophe, does little to impress a nonscientific audience of the tremendous paradigmatic shift that quantum mechanics represented. Mathematical descriptions of the wave function can also fail to impart to the audience the true nature of the quantum measurement problem and its implications for our concept of reality. Presenting both Bell's theorem and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in a heuristic framework allows for a conceptual-based discussion of quantum phenomena suitable for a mathematically naive undergraduate or an interested nonscientist.
