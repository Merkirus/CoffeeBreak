        "description":"The College of Lake County Regional Photonics Initiative project was motivated in part by the hiring of out-of-state technicians for local Photonics industry positions. Fifteen high paying employment opportunities during the recent recession could not be filled from the locally available workforce. Research on the current demand and future growth of this industry led to inquiry regarding the feasibility of establishing a photonics program at the College of Lake County. With support from National Center for Optics and Photonics Technology, Indian Hills Community College in Iowa, consultation with local industry, and funding from the NSF (National Science Foundation) ATE (Advanced Technical Education) program, the first Lasers, Photonics, and Optics certificate program was established. This immediately provided photonics skills and employment opportunities to students, many of whom were already working in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) related fields.",

        "description":"Many of the advances in telecommunications and medicine are due to laser and fiber-optic technology. This technology has led to devices that provide faster and richer communication, advanced surgeries, and faster healing times, as well as amazing robotics for manufacturing. But, as with all equipment, someone has to install and maintain it. That is what photonics technicians do. These professionals are responsible for building, installing, testing, and maintaining optical and fiber-optic equipment such as lasers, lenses, and optics systems. In this article, the author discusses everything students need to know about careers for photonics technicians--wages, responsibilities, education and skills needed, advancement possibilities, and more.",

A qualitative analysis of transcripts from interviews conducted with 33 employees at 15 companies produced five prevalent themes related to what optics and photonics employees consider competent communication (proactive questioning, efficient decision-making, familial-like humor, tactful translation, and fluent modality switching) and three socialization processes (presumed competence, informal mentoring, and structured training). These competencies and processes necessitate what we term &quot;cross-occupational communication&quot;: an interactive, iterative process involving communicative needs assessment, information exchange, and rhetorical/situational flexibility with groups distinct in background, training, and occupational role. It is difficult to create workplace-like experiences that truly capture the field-specific communication practices involved in organizational socialization within traditional classrooms; therefore, we argue for systematic and intentional communication in the disciplines instruction that considers cross-occupational communication needs in the workforce.",

        "author":["Gamo, Javier"],
        "description":"Contribution: There are many on-line resources available to learn about optics and photonics, but no assessment tools exist to evaluate the learning achievements. This paper presents an assessment framework whose validity has been proven on a course with over 70 engineering students. Background: There is evidence that on-line resources complement the learning experience in many engineering fields. In the context of optics and photonics, it may be worthwhile to assess the learning experience of engineering students taking a virtual lab as a complement to on-site, traditional lab. The assessment should use empiric, measurable results that demonstrates the effectiveness of the didactic innovation proposed, based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Intended Outcomes: Students using OPTILAB software are expected to be able to demonstrate their learning of optics and photonics by having a good score in the specific question about optical diffraction included in the final exam. Application Design: OPTILAB software, simulating the optical diffraction produced by different apertures, was developed. Students use OPTILAB to check, in advance, the experimental results they will obtain in the on-site lab, with various optical apertures and settings. This is expected to make the on-site lab session more efficient, minimize errors that inevitably occur when students are confronted with a new physical phenomenon, and ultimately increase the students learning experience. Findings: The marks obtained in the exercise about optics in the final exam by the experimental set (~67.3%) and control set (~49.2%) demonstrate that OPTILAB can improve students' learning experience in optics. The findings from the survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model are also discussed.",

        "description":"In order to increase scientific literacy and the knowledge of science and technology of Europe's citizens, the European Commission suggests a more student-centred implementation of natural sciences in education systems. Inquiry-based learning (IBL) is not only an accepted method to promote students' interest and motivation, it also helps students learn the scientific method and fosters their research skills. However, IBL is rarely used in European classrooms. The main reason is that due to the strict curricula teachers do not have the time for preparation and they do not feel well equipped and trained in the use of IBL methods in class. The Photonics Explorer programme addresses these problems on the European level. Within the programme, a pan-European collaboration of professors, teachers and photonics experts have developed the Photonics Explorer kit for the teaching of optics and light-related topics in physics across various European secondary school curricula. It is designed for intra-curricular use and contains specially designed, hands-on experimental components, worksheets based on guided IBL and multimedia material. Additionally, the kit provides a teacher guide with a suggested lesson outline and sufficient background information for each topic. (Contains 3 figures.)",

        "description":"We analyse two-mirror resonators in terms of their fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) properties. We use the basic ABCD ray transfer matrix method to show how the resonator can be regarded as the cascade of two propagation-lens-propagation FRFT systems. Then, we present a connection between the geometric properties of the resonator (the g parameters) and those of the equivalent FRFT systems (the FRFT order and scaling parameters). Expressions connecting Gaussian beam \"q\"-transformation with FRFT parameters are derived. In particular, we show that the beam waist of the resonator's mode is located at the plane leading to two FRFT subsystems with equal scaling parameter which, moreover, coincides with the mode Rayleigh range. Finally we analyse the resonator's stability diagram in terms of the fractional orders of each FRFT subsystem, and the round trip propagation. The presented analysis represents an interesting link between two topics (optical resonators and Fourier optics) usually covered in optics and photonics courses at university level, which can be useful to teach and connect the principles of these subjects.

These beams provide a simple model of the field generated in the resonant cavities of lasers, thus constituting a basic element for understanding laser theory. Usually, uniformly polarized beams are considered in the analytical calculations, with the electric field vibrating at normal planes to the propagation direction. However, such paraxial fields do not verify the Maxwell equations. In this paper we discuss how to overcome this apparent contradiction and evaluate the longitudinal component that any paraxial Gaussian beam should exhibit. Despite the fact that the assumption of a purely transverse paraxial field is useful and accurate, the inclusion of the above issue in the program helps students to clarify the importance of the electromagnetic nature of light, thus providing a more complete understanding of the paraxial approach.

Background: At most schools, optics is an elective &quot;niche&quot; area involving a single senior course. This presents challenges, since the topic has breadth and depth, leaving little time for application projects. Yet, seniors want future applicability. After many years, the instructor questioned his &quot;broad-brush&quot; approach involving many topics with limited application, especially given the role of optics and photonics in technology leadership. A literature search uncovered recent use of project-based methods for optics in K-12 and community colleges but little use in U.S. universities, suggesting an opportunity. Intended Outcomes: The authors intended that achievement and valuation by students would be greater with authentic projects and less content. Application Design: Therefore, an approach that concentrated content and project work on light's dualistic nature in a mathematically rigorous manner was taken. With reduced content, class time was available for PBL, whereby the problem motivated the content. For light's wave nature, five lecture weeks were followed by a project simulating the propagation of light. For the particle nature, a circuit design project to implement analog electronic circuits during class occurred after five lecture weeks. Findings: Student interviews and instructor perspectives on impacts of learning, career preparation, graduate school interest, and in-class engagement uncovered encouraging results. A direct assessment showed significantly higher homework scores with the course changes.",

        "description":"A group comparison experiment of two high school classes with pre and post instruction testing has been carried out to study the suitability and advantages of using the active learning of optics and photonics (ALOP) curricula in high schools of developing countries. Two parallel, mixed gender, 12th grade classes of a high school run by the local university were chosen. One course was randomly selected to follow the experimental instruction, based on teacher and student activities contained in the ALOP Manual. The other course followed the traditional, teacher-centered, instruction previously practiced. Conceptual knowledge of the characteristics of image formation by plane mirrors and single convergent and divergent lenses was measured by applying, in both courses, the multiple-choice test, light and optics conceptual evaluation (LOCE). Measurement before instruction showed that initial knowledge was almost null, and therefore equivalent, in both courses. After instruction testing showed that the conceptual knowledge of students following the ALOP curricula more than doubled that achieved by students in the control course, a situation maintained throughout the six conceptual dimensions tested by the 34 questions of the LOCE test used in this experiment. Using a 60% performance level on the LOCE test as the threshold of satisfactory performance, most (about 90%) of the experimental group achieved this level--independent of initial knowledge, while no student following traditional instruction reached this level of understanding. Some considerations and recommendations for prospective users are also included.",

        "description":"This work shows the production steps of two optical fibre sensing setups which were specially designed for the activities of the 2018 Photonics Lab Open Day realized at the Federal University of Technology-Paraná in Brazil as a celebration of the first International Day of Light (16 May). The systems are based on the sensing properties of fibre Bragg gratings, a well-established photonic sensing technology but not covered in regular undergraduate Optics courses. The demonstrations of optical fibre sensing properties by means of funny scientific activities intended to stimulate high school and college students' interest in science, seeking greater engagement of these students in the research projects developed at the University. Fibre Bragg ability of detecting mechanical vibration and temperature changes was used to measure the temperature of the attendee's breath and vibrations produced during a short walk. Demonstrations were realized in a contest where students were challenged to walk smoothly over a flat surface instrumented with vibration sensors, as well as to blow into a tube containing the temperature sensor. Steps of the sensing systems implementation are provided in detail including aspects concerning to the choice of the apparatus design and the installation of the sensors.",

The simulation-based learning course enables students to understand the influences on LED performance of the variation of different parameters and to seek the best design through comparing the effectiveness of different combinations of parameters. The evaluation results of pre- and post-test knowledge maps and a photonics scoreboard indicate that this project-based instruction may help students understand the operating principles of LEDs and enhance their skill in LED design. The Constructivist Project-based Learning Environment Survey is adopted to demonstrate that the proposed project-based learning environment is beneficial in cultivating student inquiry learning, reflective thinking, teamwork, and skills in creative problem solving.
