        "author":["Bhattacharyya, Anita"],
        "description":"Our bodies are made up of over 250 specific cell types, and all initially arise from stem cells during embryonic development. Stem cells have two characteristics that make them unique: (1) they are pluripotent, meaning that they can differentiate into all cell types of the body, and (2) they are capable of self-renewal to generate more of themselves and are thus able to populate an organism. Human pluripotent stem cells were first isolated from human embryos twenty years ago (Thomson et al., 1998) and more recently, technology to reprogram somatic cells, such as skin and blood, to induced pluripotent stem cells has emerged (Park et al., 2008; Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007). Induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, are particularly valuable as disease specific iPSCs can be generated from individuals with specific genetic mutations diseases. Researchers have harnessed the power of stem cells to understand many aspects of developmental biology in model organisms (e.g. worms, mice) and more recently, in humans. Human stem cells in culture recapitulate development. For example, formation of the brain occurs prenatally and follows a specific pattern of timing and cell generation. Human stem cells in the culture dish follow a similar pattern when exposed to developmental cues and can thus be used to understand aspects of prenatal human brain development that are not accessible by other means. Disease-specific iPSCs are a valuable tool to model neural development in specific neurodevelopmental disorders like Down syndrome. Down syndrome is a classic developmental disorder; mistakes that are made during development of a particular organ system result in the characteristics of the disorder. In the brain, mistakes during prenatal brain development lead to intellectual disability. Trisomy 21 (Ts21) iPSCs generated from somatic cells of Down syndrome individuals may enable us to understand the mistakes made during Down syndrome brain development.",

        "description":"In this study, we examined 96 undergraduate non-science majors' conceptions of stem cells, stem cell research, and cloning. This study was performed at a large, Midwest, research extensive university. Participants in the study were asked to answer 23 questions relating to stem cells, stem cell research, and cloning in an on-line assessment before and after instruction. Two goals of the instruction were to: (1) help students construct accurate scientific ideas, and (2) enhance their reasoning about socioscientific issues. The course structure included interactive lectures, case discussions, hands-on activities, and independent projects. Overall, students' understandings of stem cells, stem cell research, and cloning increased from pre-test to post-test. For example, on the post-test, students gained knowledge concerning the age of an organism related to the type of stem cell it possesses. However, we found that some incorrect ideas that were evident on the pre-test persisted after instruction. For example, before and after instruction several students maintained the idea that stem cells can currently be used to produce organs.",

        "description":"It seems hard to believe that Dolly the cloned sheep was born 10 years ago, kindling furious arguments over the prospects and ethics of cloning a human. Today, the controversy over cloning is entwined, often confused, with concerns over the use of human embryonic stem cells. Most people are unclear what cloning is, and they know even less when it comes to stem cells. In teaching, it can be engaging to lead with a controversy or to start with the medical promise of a given research topic. For stem cells, however, it is important to impress upon students the essential role of stem cells in the natural processes of development and regeneration before getting into potential medical benefits, let alone controversies. This article focuses on stem cells: What are they? What aren't they? and What are the ethical issues that students should consider? (Contains 7 figures.)",

        "description":"Stem cell therapy has recently progressed from the preclinical to the early clinical trial arena for a variety of diseases. Moreover, the medical students lack the deep and full understanding of its significance and potential as the promising future cure for diverse diseases worldwide. This study aims at evaluating the knowledge, awareness, and perception of medical students as far as stem cells applications are related in the medical field. A cross-sectional survey was carried out using online questionnaires, which were distributed via e-mail to cover all medical faculties in Jordan. The data show that medical students are supportive of using stem cells and their therapeutic applications, and most of them are willing and enthusiastically want to improve their knowledge about stem cells; however, due to the tight schedule and the lack of an elective course about stem cells in the curriculum, many of them are not ready to undergo further training in regenerative medicine unless it becomes part of the assigned training and part of the learning objectives for medical students. These findings indicated the need to update the medical school curriculum with new hits in medicine and expand the range of courses offered for medical students so they can be up-to-date with the quick advances in different medical disciplines.",

As a known characteristic of stem cells is that they are slow-cycling in vivo, the purpose of this prospective controlled study was to identify and quantify slow-cycling cells or putative stem cells in murine vocal fold epithelium. Method: Twelve mice were administered daily intraperitoneal injections of a nucleotide dye, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), over 7 consecutive days. Under this pulse-chase paradigm, slow-cycling cells retain the dye (label-retaining cells; LRCs) while more rapidly cycling cells lose dye to dilution during multiple cell divisions. The percentage of label-retaining cells (%LRCs) was calculated following a chase period of 2, 4, and 8 weeks postinjections. Results: The %LRCs decreased significantly from 9.4% at 2 weeks to 3.1% at 8 weeks following injections (p less than 0.05). No statistically significant differences in the quantity of BrdU-positive cells were measured between the anterior, mid-membranous, or cartilaginous regions of the vocal fold (p greater than 0.05). Conclusion: These findings are consistent with the presence and first report of a small population of putative stem cells along the length of murine vocal fold epithelium.",

        "description":"These are interesting days in the scientific, social, and political debates about human  embryonic stem cell research. Pluripotent stem cells--cells that can, in principle, give rise to the body's full range of cell types--were previously derivable only from human embryos that were destroyed in the process. Now, a variety of somatic cell types can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state. Meanwhile, long-standing promises about the therapeutic potential of pluripotent stem cells are inching toward realization, as several early-phase clinical studies are underway. At the same time, despite presidential declarations in favor of expanding human embryonic stem cell research, the regulatory environment is as complex as ever. Scientifically, clinically, socially, and politically, the stem cell debates are far from over. So, should federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research be expanded, diminished, or halted altogether? Ethical, legal, and regulatory issues associated with federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research in the United States have influenced the character and  trajectory of the field in profound ways. These authors contend that discussions about the significance of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for federal funding policy ought not be reduced to technical debate; moral disagreement cannot be reduced to a calculus of biological sameness--nor should it be. They also state that when scientists acquiesce to pressures to resolve problems of politics through scientific expertise, they place unsustainable burdens on science, straining its limits and compromising its ability to serve its important political role.",

        "description":"The hippocampal dentate gyrus maintains its capacity to generate new neurons throughout life. In animal models, hippocampal neurogenesis is increased by cognitive tasks, and experimental ablation of neurogenesis disrupts specific modalities of learning and memory. In humans, the impact of neurogenesis on cognition remains unclear. Here, we assessed the neurogenic potential in the human hippocampal dentate gyrus by isolating adult human neural stem cells from 23 surgical \"en bloc\" hippocampus resections. After proliferation of the progenitor cell pool \"in vitro\" we identified two distinct patterns. Adult human neural stem cells with a high proliferation capacity were obtained in 11 patients. Most of the cells in the high proliferation capacity cultures were capable of neuronal differentiation (53 plus or minus 13% of \"in vitro\" cell population). A low proliferation capacity was observed in 12 specimens, and only few cells differentiated into neurons (4 plus or minus 2%). This was reflected by reduced numbers of proliferating cells \"in vivo\" as well as granule cells immunoreactive for doublecortin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the low proliferation capacity group. High and low proliferation capacity groups differed dramatically in declarative memory tasks. Patients with high proliferation capacity stem cells had a normal memory performance prior to epilepsy surgery, while patients with low proliferation capacity stem cells showed severe learning and memory impairment. Histopathological examination revealed a highly significant correlation between granule cell loss in the dentate gyrus and the same patient's regenerative capacity \"in vitro\" (r = 0.813; P less than 0.001; linear regression: R[superscript 2][subscript adjusted] = 0.635), as well as the same patient's ability to store and recall new memories (r = 0.966; P = 0.001; linear regression: R[superscript 2][subscript adjusted] = 0.9). Our results suggest that encoding new memories is related to the regenerative capacity of the hippocampus in the human brain.",

        "description":"Stem cells are cells that can self-renew and differentiate into a variety of cell types under certain conditions. Stem cells have great potential in regenerative medicine and cell therapy for the treatment of certain diseases. To deliver knowledge about this frontier in science and technology to medical undergraduate students, we designed an innovative practical experiment for freshmen in their second semester. The lab exercise focused on rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) isolation, cell culture and differentiation, and it aimed to help students master the aseptic techniques for cell culture, the basic methods and procedures for the primary culture and passage of BMSCs, the basic procedure for the directional differentiation of BMSCs into adipocytes and their subsequent identification by oil-red-O staining. This lab exercise is a very meaningful and useful introduction to stem cell collection and manipulation and inspires medical students to deepen their understanding of translational medicine and regenerative medicine.",

        "description":"Stem cells are being touted as the greatest discovery for the potential treatment of a myriad of diseases in the new millennium, but there is still much research to be done before it will be known whether they can live up to this description. There is also an ethical debate over the production of one of the most valuable types of stem cell: the embryonic form. Consequently, there is public confusion over the benefits currently being derived from the use of stem cells and what can potentially be expected from their use in the future. The health educator's role is to give an unbiased account of the current state of stem cell research. This paper provides the groundwork by discussing the types of cells currently identified, their potential use, and some of the political and ethical pitfalls resulting from such use.

        "description":"The intersection of science and our society has led to legal and ethical issues in which we all play a part. To support development of scientific literacy, college science courses need to engage students in difficult dialogues around ethical issues. We describe a new course, Stem Cells and Society, in which students explore the basic biology of stem cell research and the controversy surrounding it. As part of the course, we highlight the nature of science, looking at the methods and norms within the scientific community. To gain a perspective on the current stem cell controversy, we examine the public debates in the 1970s surrounding in vitro fertilization, the stem cell initiative in Missouri, and the personal and religious viewpoints that have emerged relative to the stem cell debate. In the Stem Cells and Society course, students are challenged to develop and clarify their own personal positions concerning embryonic stem cell research. These positions are grounded in science, religion or personal philosophy, and law. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)",

However, preventive interventions based on this theory have often been ineffective. This article proffers a developmental theory, which is based on recent epidemiologic research and a new line of research dealing with differentiation of immature stem cells into mature tissues. This theory posits that the mechanical stimulation provided by vigorous physical activity (PA) causes immature stem cells to differentiate into lean tissue cells rather than into fat cells. If this new theory is confirmed by future research, it implies that interventions that involve adequate doses of vigorous PA, along with appropriate diet composition, may be especially effective in promoting development of healthy bodies.

        "description":"The study of the developing brain has begun to shed light on the underpinnings of both early and adult onset neuropsychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging of the human brain across developmental time points and the use of model animal systems have combined to reveal brain systems and gene products that may play a role in autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and many other neurodevelopmental conditions. However, precisely how genes may function in human brain development and how they interact with each other leading to psychiatric disorders is unknown. Because of an increasing understanding of neural stem cells and how the nervous system subsequently develops from these cells, we have now the ability to study disorders of the nervous system in a new way--by rewinding and reviewing the development of human neural cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), developed from mature somatic cells, have allowed the development of specific cells in patients to be observed in real time. Moreover, they have allowed some neuronal-specific abnormalities to be corrected with pharmacological intervention in tissue culture. These exciting advances based on the use of iPSCs hold great promise for understanding, diagnosing and, possibly, treating psychiatric disorders. Specifically, examination of iPSCs from typically developing individuals will reveal how basic cellular processes and genetic differences contribute to individually unique nervous systems. Moreover, by comparing iPSCs from typically developing individuals and patients, differences at stem cell stages, through neural differentiation, and into the development of functional neurons may be identified that will reveal opportunities for intervention. The application of such techniques to early onset neuropsychiatric disorders is still on the horizon but has become a reality of current research efforts as a consequence of the revelations of many years of basic developmental neurobiological science.",
