Grasping the underlying processes requires students to synthesize knowledge of several different topical areas. The activity presented here uses an innovative experiment to connect chemistry concepts with an interesting geochemical feature of the natural world, whether a cave, rock outcrop, or even a deteriorating building. Demonstrating formation of a dripstone engages students' interest, offers a useful conceptual anchor for related topics in the classroom, and provides students with more practice in gaining basic laboratory skills.",
