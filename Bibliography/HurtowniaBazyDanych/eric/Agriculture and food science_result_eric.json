Chapters discuss: (1) development of agriculture (beginning and modern); (2) agroecosystems (land utilization, soils, food production, irrigation, and fertilizers); (3) agricultural development and food production (economics, crop zones, land development, agrochemicals, and others); (4) biotechnology and agriculture (plant tissue culture, genetic engineering, animal husbandry, food losses after harvest, and others); (5) agriculture, people and food (malnutrition, protein foods, food zones, and the future); and (6) teaching agriculture in biology courses (agriculture/education, issues, and  teaching/learning strategies). Numerous charts and graphs provide information and comparisons in an international basis for many of the subjects addressed, including soils distribution, areas under irrigation, crop zones, and land development/productivity. There are also several comparisons of major food crops for production, loss, and affect of growth substances. &quot;Agricultural Aspects of Biology Education&quot; is presented in table format and includes areas of concern, practical experiences, and teaching/learning strategies. The background material should provide teachers with resources for infusing various agricultural topics into the biology curriculum. (DH)",

The sixth chapter is a curriculum guide for teaching about  agriculture in biology courses. Comments on how the subject fits into secondary school biology courses, descriptions of various teaching and learning strategies, and a chart on agricultural aspects of biological education (listing areas of concern and concepts, principles, and/or topics with related practical experiences, teaching/learning strategies, and values/skills fostered) are included.

School-based agricultural education offers a valuable platform to connect AFNR and science; however, interdisciplinary teaching requires willing and able teachers. The current study considered the intentions of school-based agriculture teachers to teach science within AFNR curriculum. Using the theory of planned behavior, attitude toward teaching science, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived science knowledge were considered as independent variables to teaching science within AFNR curriculum. The explanatory model was analyzed using structural equation modeling. In total, school-based agriculture teachers intended to teach science in 39.91% of AFNR curriculum. Only perceived science knowledge was a statistically significant, negative predictor of intended science teaching. Findings pinpoint the need for additional research into the unexpected relationship between perceived science knowledge and science teaching intentions. The need and nature of potential explorations, along with specific recommendations for practice, are discussed.",

        "description":"High school students' prevalence as food-service industry employees and their lack of food safety knowledge make them prime candidates for food safety education. The researchers developed a food-safety-focused curriculum for high school students aligned with Indiana Academic Standards for Agriculture, Advanced Life Science: Food. The curriculum was designed to provide students with fundamental food safety concepts through experiential learning and incorporation of science, technology, engineering, agriculture, and mathematics (STEAM) activities in the context of different careers related to agriculture, especially in food science. This study uses the Delphi technique to evaluate the food safety curriculum, including the identification of barriers to incorporating the curriculum into classrooms. The Delphi technique uses an expert panel to generate consensus related to a topic. A panel of experts in the field of education evaluated the curriculum through three rounds of surveys containing questions related to six curriculum assessment topics. Experts rated the degree to which they agreed with statements about the curriculum using a 5-point Likert scale and multiple-choice questions. At the conclusion of the study, the cost to purchase materials for cooking labs was the only identified barrier to curriculum incorporation (62.5%). Experts agreed that the curriculum addressed academic standards (100%), was engaging for students (100.0%), was easy for teachers to use (89.5%), and successfully incorporated STEAM (100.0%), experiential learning (89.5%), and career-education (78.9%). This study highlights the feasibility of providing food safety education to high school students in less traditional disciplines while promoting career development through the incorporation of experiential learning, STEAM, and career-education components.",

A panel of 117 experts identified a total of 162 disciplinary core ideas of STEM concepts inherent in the Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (AFNR) career pathways. The structure for agricultural education curriculum development suggested by this research (Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Disciplinary Core Ideas) is supported by recent National Research Council (2012) publications. It is prudent that the agricultural education profession utilizes structures that have been proven effective, both empirically and in practice, by other related STEM disciplines. Furthermore, utilizing a structure like other STEM disciplines will aid in cross-curricular collaborations at the local, state and national levels. If agriculture educators desire to show how agriculture is a science, as an example, then the agriculture STEM matrix should reflect the framework of AFNR agriculture and science education. The matrix should serve as the foundation for addressing curricular and teacher professional development needs.",

The materials are color-coded, falling into four categories: language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. Each exercise includes background information, concepts, and objectives for the teacher. The language arts series directs students to write descriptive paragraphs, to read, and to create a bulletin-board forest scene while learning about plants and animals. The mathematics section offers puzzles and word problems having to do with food and animals. Activities in the science section focus on plant and animal life studies, helping students to learn plant and animal parts and to understand the life cycle  of honeybees. The social studies materials teach children the history of the horse's role in society. Another unit describes food production through history, including the Stone Age, early civilization, ancient Egypt, Europe, and the American colonies. Subjects also include the steam engine and modern farm machinery. The document offers word puzzles and line drawings for students to color. Additional resources include a booklet--&quot;Bud's World&quot;--on American agriculture and wildlife, a wall poster, a small coloring book, a booklet on wheat, and a U.S Department of Agriculture bibliography of 328 educational resources about agriculture.

        "description":"This resource guide provides a list of materials available from public and private sources on agriculture and related issues. More than 300 organizations and publishers were asked what materials they were producing that could help regular K-12 classroom teachers incorporate more information about agriculture into their instruction. This guide is comprised of those materials. The materials are divided into four sections: (1) printed materials (books, pamphlets, activity and coloring books, and packets or kits of printed materials); (2) audiovisuals, posters and teaching kits (slide sets, videotapes, transparencies, and computer software); (3) resource guides or catalogs; and (4) miscellaneous. In addition to a title index, the guide contains indexes for the content areas of  Agriculture and History, the Geography of Agriculture, Agricultural Science and Technology, Agricultural Economics and Society, Agriculture and the World, Careers, Agriculture and Public Policy, Agriculture and the Environment, Nutrition and Food Safety, Materials with Guides for Teachers, and State-Related Materials. Items are listed by title, publisher, and grade level. Format, a description of the content, and price and ordering information are included for almost every entry. (PVD)",
