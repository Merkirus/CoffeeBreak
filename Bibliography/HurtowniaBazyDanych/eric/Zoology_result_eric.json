        "description":"This study compared the effectiveness of three sequences of prerequisite courses required before taking zoology. Sequence 1 prerequisite courses consisted of general biology and human biology; Sequence 2 consisted of general biology; and Sequence 3 required cell biology. Zoology students in the spring of 1972 were pretest and a posttest. The mean difference scores on these tests were compared for all three sequences by using the t-test at the .05 confidence level. Correlation coefficient were determined for SAT scores and zoology final examination percent score, zoology final examination percent score and zoology final grade, final grades in prerequisite courses, and final grade in zoology for all the sequences. Zoology final examination items were categorized, and the bias of  the examination was determined. Students were characterized with respect to level and orientation of their subsequent biology courses and their attitudes and reasoning abilities. The study found no significant relationships between performance in zoology and performance in prerequisite courses of the three sequences. (Author/BR)",

        "description":"Studied were the characteristics and changes of textbooks used in college zoology instruction in the United States and the relationship of these findings to the development of college zoology instruction. The authors' professional backgrounds, the textbook audience, and the status of zoology and college education at the time each book was written were investigated to evaluate their influences on the writing of the text. This study revealed that changes in zoology textbooks not only affected many aspects of college instruction, but that the changes themselves were influenced by diverse educational and scientific factors. The changes failed to keep pace with advances in science, education, and current needs. Although modern textbooks have attempted to bridge this gap, the needs of  future zoology textbooks should be examined in light of anticipated scientific progress. (BC)",

Though partly rewritten, and with additions regarding the habits of birds and mammals, portions of the larger book have been retained, the more difficult parts being omitted so as to adapt it for younger pupils, or those whose time is limited. No class in the study of Zoology should depend on a book alone, but specimens should be in constant use--the text-book being rather for reference--as all school work in Zoology should be object-teaching.",

This report describes a survey of American four-year colleges and universities offering biology and/or zoology degrees. Questionnaires were sent to 741 biology and zoology departments asking for the current course requirements for majors, and for novel or innovative curricular features. Replies were received from 270 departments. From the results, very few unusual curricula in biology were detected. A majority of colleges (70.3%) require at least a semester of introductory biology, genetics, ecology, physiology, and cell biology. An even greater majority of colleges (79.3%) require at least a  semester of chemistry and physics, and organic chemistry. There are far more similarities than differences in the course requirements of the departments. The only surprise was that smaller, lower ranked colleges are more likely to have a research and undergraduate seminar requirement than research-oriented colleges. (PR)",
