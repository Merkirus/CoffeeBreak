        "description":"In March, 1973, after a review of the Ontario universities' three-year plans, a provisional embargo was placed on doctoral work in biophysics. A full-scale assessment with outside consultants was not necessary in the case of a provisional embargo. Instead, the method used to remove the embargo was self-study by the discipline group leading to a report to the Advisory Committee on Academic Planning (ACAP), which, in turn, makes recommendations to the Council of Ontario Universities (COU). The report is one of a series of disciplinary studies whose emphasis is on forward planning, and it is hoped that the implementation of COU's recommendation will help to ensure the more ordered growth and development of graduate studies in Ontario's universities. The monograph includes the&quot;Biophysics Planning Study&quot; containing specific recommendations concerning biophysics graduate studies; the graduate programs established and proposed in Ontario prepared by the discipline group; and the universities' comments.

        "author":["Castanho, Miguel A. R. B."],
        "description":"The main distinction between the overlapping fields of molecular biophysics and biochemistry resides in their different approaches to the same problems. Molecular biophysics makes more use of physical techniques and focuses on quantitative data. This difference encounters two difficult pedagogical challenges when teaching molecular biophysics to biochemistry majors; an aversion to math, \"Mathematophobia\", combined with little appreciation for the importance of models in scientific progress. To overcome these problems, I have used an heuristic approach to student learning. Although inspired by problem-based learning, it has a lesser demand for material resources and can be managed by a single teacher in small classes. This approach is especially suited for elective courses in the final years of a program of study. It consists of teaching/touching the art of discovery by turning laboratories into original research projects and lectures into seminars. (Contains 4 footnotes.)",

        "description":"Improving the scientific literacy of non-scientists is an important aim, both because of the ever-increasing impact of science on our lives and because understanding science enriches our experience of the natural world. One route to improving scientific literacy is via general education undergraduate courses--i.e. courses for students not majoring in the sciences or engineering. Because it encompasses a variety of important scientific concepts, demonstrates connections between basic science and real-world applications and illustrates the creative ways in which scientific insights develop, biophysics is a useful subject with which to promote scientific literacy. I describe here a course on biophysics for non-science-major undergraduates recently developed at the University of Oregon (Eugene, OR, USA), noting its design, which spans both macroscopic and microscopic topics, and the specific content of a few of its modules. I also describe evidence-based pedagogical approaches adopted in teaching the course and aspects of course enrollment and evaluation.",

Comparison of quenching efficiencies for free tryptophan in solution and partially buried in cyt \"c\" highlights the persistence of residual structure in unfolded proteins and deepens students' understanding of protein structures and dynamics. The experiment builds on our previous laboratory module that probed thermodynamics and structures of cyt \"c\"; collectively, these protein-folding experiments and related topics provide physical chemistry students with opportunities to explore a comprehensive set of spectroscopy and biophysics tools.
