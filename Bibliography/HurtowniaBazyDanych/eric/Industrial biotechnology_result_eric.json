        "description":"For many years, humankind has been incorporating biosciences in different places--from agriculture to food and medicine. Today, the nomenclature of biology has been recoined as Biotechnology, a technological science with a perfect blend of sophisticated techniques, manuals and application of fast delivery equipment and vehicles. It encompasses chemical engineering, bioprocess engineering, bioinformatics (computer aided biotechnological science), biosensor, robotics and many more. Biotechnology is so advanced that it requires multiple phased regulatory systems to check the ethical issues in industry. In raising the biotechnology industry, the government has extended support like financial assistance and infrastructure. But to transform any industry there is a great demand from industry/academia to come and share knowledge and upgrade the demands as industrial products and services. On this road map to industrial development and its strengthening, academia needs to focus on policies framework and plan for a better industrial maneuvers to achieve set goals.",

        "description":"The recent growth of biotechnology requires a wide range of expertise within the industry. Education is the primary platform for students to gain information and knowledge on biotechnology. In Malaysia where biotechnology is relatively new, education programs and courses must be tailored to meet the demands of the industry. A combination of theoretical knowledge as well as practical and industrial training is essential to ensure graduates are prepared for their career in the fields of biotechnology. Results from this study show that university students lack literacy on biotechnology information and access to facilities provided by the universities. This may be a significant contributing factor to the lack of knowledge and information amongst graduates. Furthermore comparative analysis on the biotechnology program in Malaysian universities with that of other countries show the need to restructure the program by offering more specialized courses as well as soft skills and business subjects. This is to meet the demands of the related professionals as well as the various branches that exist in the biotechnology industry.",

Universities of Technology interweave technology with university endeavours; focusing on the know-how for the fabrication of things, and the skill to manage fabricated products. These universities are well placed to offer qualifications in biotechnology. Biotechnology encompasses many technologies using living organisms, their parts and products for commercial purposes. The development of the biotechnology is a national priority and enjoys support from government and funding bodies in South Africa. Challenges faced by educational systems include, curricular content and pedagogies in the rapidly changing biotechnology landscape, diversity of entering students, and expectations of the industry. Graduate attributes were devised and used to devise postgraduate curricula for biotechnology at Universities of Technology following an embedded approach.

There is, however, considerable variation in the extent and manner of ethics education provided to students in different institutions. In addition, the perceived need that students and employers have regarding ethics education, and the aims and expected outcomes of ethics education, are rarely made clear. This research reports the findings of a questionnaire administered to 375 undergraduate biotechnology students from 19 Australian universities to determine their attitudes towards the teaching of ethics. The results suggest that undergraduate biotechnology students generally regard ethics education to be important and that ethics should be included in undergraduate biotechnology curricula. Students tended, however, to emphasize the professional and industrial side of ethics and not to recognize the personal effects of morals and behaviour. We provide suggestions for rethinking how ethics should be taught. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "author":["Patton, Madeline"],
        "description":"How to strengthen technician education to meet the needs of the biotechnology industry was the question before the 50 people who participated in the \"Educating Biotechnicians for Future Industry Needs\" conference from April 28 to 30 in Scottsdale, Arizona. The participants were from higher education, secondary schools, industry, government, and professional organizations. The conference specifically addressed industry needs for the next five years within the areas of health, medical, agriculture, industrial and environmental biotechnology, and emerging areas such as biotechnology with microelectromechanical systems (BioMEMs) and nanotechnology (Bionanotechnology), and personalized medicine. The National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored the conference through a grant to the American Association of Community Colleges, which represents more than 1,200 associate degree-granting institutions that enroll more than 12 million students--almost half of all U.S. undergraduates. The NSF regularly brings together scientists, educators, and other stakeholders to share their opinions on critical issues such as biotechnology workforce development. The NSF currently provides $16.3 million in support of biotechnology programs through its Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program. These initiatives include the ATE Resource Center in Biotechnology (Bio-Link) at the City College of San Francisco; and the Northeast Biomanufacturing Center and Collaborative (NBC[superscript 2]) at Great Bay Community College. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) also supports biotechnology workforce development through 25 awards in the President's High Growth Job Training Initiative and Community-Based Job Training Grants and 17 WIRED regions that have a focus on bioscience and biotechnology. In addition to the recommendations, the report summarizes key points from five panel discussions: health and medical, industrial and environmental, food and agriculture, education, and emerging issues. Panelists shared their opinions about how the biotechnology industry will grow during the next five years, the skills that technicians will require to meet workforce needs, and their experiences with promising educational practices. The small and large group discussions that followed each panel presentation led to the recommendations. The report is intended to guide community colleges and other educational institutions as they align their biotechnician education programs with anticipated workforce needs during the next five years, to inform funding organizations' efforts to support biotechnician education, to encourage stakeholders' involvement in biotechnician education programs, and to prompt individuals and organizations to carry out the recommendations developed during the conference.",

This case study on antibody purification was implemented in a chromatographic separations course. Parametric simulations were performed to investigate the effect of operating parameters (e.g., feed load, salt concentration) on the productivity and yield of this separation process. The course project served to teach students basic simulator operation, apply course material to a separation challenge from the biotechnology industry, and open-ended problem exploration for process optimization.",

        "description":"New techniques have expanded the field of biotechnology and awarded scientists an unprecedented degree of control over the genetic constitutions of living things. The knowledge of DNA science is the basis for this burgeoning industry which may be a major force in human existence. Just as it is possible to move genetic material from one organism to another, scientists intend to transfer normal genes into somatic cells in order to correct severe genetic disorders. This procedure, called gene therapy, causes some critics to fear that human gene therapy might be used to alter fundamental human traits such as intelligence, personality, or physical appearance. Although scientists counter that it is unlikely that complex human traits can ever be altered by genetic means, the anxiety  continues to generate public controversy. This monograph endeavors to help gain public acceptance by providing clear and accurate information, including benefits and risks, about biotechnology by discussing the following topics: (1) definitions of biotechnology; (2) roots of the biological revolution; (3) tools and applications of biotechnology; (4) gene therapy; (5) agricultural and industrial applications; (6) biotech companies; and (7) regulating biotechnology and genetic engineering. Also included are a 14-page glossary of terms commonly used and a 68-item list of the literature cited. (RT)",

        "description":"This document provides an overview of the major research priorities of biotechnology and the use of what is known as &quot;regrowing raw materials&quot; in agriculture in the Federal Republic of Germany. Following an introduction, section 2 addresses biotechnology in agriculture, including biotechnology and genetic engineering, the significance of biotechnology in the agricultural and food sectors, new developments in plant breeding, examples of genetically engineered mutations in plants, biotechnology in animal production, and biotechnology and foodstuffs. Section 3 describes the state and future prospects of biological research and development West Germany, including main research centers and international cooperation. Section 4 explains the risks and dangers involved in genetic  engineering and discusses the Genetic Engineering Act to become law on January 1, 1991. Section 5 explores the future prospect of &quot;regrowing&quot;, i.e., renewable, materials. Section 6 discusses industrial uses of regrowing raw materials, including nonpolluting natural oils and fats, starch, sugar, plant fibers such as flax, and wood. Section 7 addresses regrowing raw materials as energy sources, including alcohol that is fit for transport, vegetable oils as fuels and lubricants, and heat and electricity produced from biomass for developing countries. Section 8 considers the future development of regrowing raw materials. The document concludes with addresses of relevant ministries and research institutes in West Germany and a bibliography of seven resources written in German. (CML)",
