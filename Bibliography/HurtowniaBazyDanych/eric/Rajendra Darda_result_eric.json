        "description":"Adding an evolutionary perspective to anatomy teaching can enrich student learning. One way of introducing evolutionary concepts into a course is by &quot;sneaking it in&quot; by presenting interesting and sometimes entertaining &quot;stories&quot; that add anatomical detail, encourage critical thinking, and illustrate underlying evolutionary history and concepts. The gubernaculum tells one such story; a story that involves the movement of the testes through the fetal abdominal cavity and finally into the scrotum. While it is well understood that the proximate importance of this migration is to guarantee an appropriate thermal environment for sperm production, our understanding of the role of the gubernaculum in anchoring, pulling, and clearing the way for the testes as they descend is only now coming to light. Even less clear is our understanding of the evolutionary forces that ultimately led to such a seemingly vulnerable positioning of the testes. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed, and whether one or more can ultimately explain the seemingly complicated process and curious anatomy, the essential evolutionary test has obviously been met-- it works",

        "author":["Darda, David M."],
        "description":"The observation that anatomical course offerings have decreased in undergraduate biology curricula is supported by a survey of undergraduate institutions in the state of Washington. This reduction, due partially to increased emphasis in other areas of the biology curriculum, along with the lack of anatomy prerequisites for admission to most medical and dental schools, has resulted in many biology majors who have little or no exposure to the anatomical sciences. This is a disservice to our students who need to understand organismal form and function to better connect our rapidly expanding knowledge of life at the cell and molecular level to our understanding of the role of organisms in ecosystems and as the primary target of natural selection in evolutionary change. Undergraduate anatomical courses can also serve as an &quot;extension&quot; of the anatomy curriculum in professional healthcare programs, where anatomical sciences are also experiencing a reduced allocation of instructional time. Given the importance of anatomical knowledge along with the many demands and constraints on biology curricula, what can we do? One suggestion, a course in integrative anatomy for undergraduates, is proposed and discussed. (Contains 2 figures.)",

But student responses in dialogue based tutoring systems are often grammatically and semantically incomplete and additional information (e.g., dialogue history) is needed to better assess their correctness. In that, we have proposed augmenting semantic similarity based models with, for example, knowledge level of the student and question difficulty and jointly modeled their complex interactions using Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL). The results of the proposed PSL models to infer the correctness of the given answer on DT-Grade dataset show the more than 7% improvement on accuracy over the results obtained using a semantic similarity model.

        "description":"This paper examines perceptions of professional and organizational identity of teacher educators in a &quot;new&quot; University of Technology in South Africa, resulting from several recent mergers of colleges of education and colleges of technology mainly serving formerly disadvantaged students and schools. The findings show that most staff consider teaching and research as dichotomous. Research activities are seen to satisfy the institutional requirements for securing research funding and producing publications. Professional identities could be strengthened by a faculty-wide debate on the specific profile of teacher education in a University of Technology, resulting also in an agreed research ethos. Peer support in collaborative research groups with a focus on own practice is seen as an opportunity to strengthen research expertise. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Online video games have become popular among teenage students and have drawn the attention of both parents and teachers in Nepal. We report an analysis of secondary students' experiences of playing online video games and parents' perception of their children's game behaviour. We employed online semi-structured interviews with students and parents, and observation of students' game activities. This paper reports on how online video games developed students' independent study skills and autonomous learning abilities. Video games can be an assistive tool to engage teenage learners in collaborative and autonomous learning activities. Parents, however, perceived that video games unless specifically designed for educational purposes, can negatively impact students' health. Findings suggest that the appropriate integration of video games into educational practices can strengthen students' self-learning habits and develop their capabilities.",

        "author":["Dasari, Rajendra Prasad"],
        "description":"Schools play a vital role in inculcation of values and development of values. It has become, of late, the central concern of teacher education. Teacher education programmes are the effective modes of transmission of values having a direct impact on the school education. A College of Teacher Education was established at Badrachalam exclusively for tribal population in the State of Telangana under Integral Tribal Development Authority (ITDA). In this institution only tribes of different communities are given the opportunity of pursuing B.Ed. Programme. Tribal habitat, culture and living styles are different because they live in deep forest in hamlets away from the mainstream of the society and their value system needs attention for their emancipation in social development. In this article, the value system and value preferences of tribal future teachers of the B. Ed. Programme are discussed to provide guidelines for curricular interventions for quality tribal teacher education.",
