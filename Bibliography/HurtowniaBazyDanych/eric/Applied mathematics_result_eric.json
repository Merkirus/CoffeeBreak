The primary goal is to compare the perceptions of students in applied math and students in algebra 1 on mathematics as a school subject. Students (n=490) in four Missouri school districts participated in this study which employed a posttest-only control group design. Findings suggest that applied courses enable students to have positive perceptions of mathematics as a subject and provide a basis for students to develop an appreciation for the use of  mathematics on the job. Teacher interviews also support the finding that students exhibit a renewed interest in mathematics following an applied math course. Contains 36 references. (DDR)",

        "description":"Implementation of nationally developed applied academics curriculum packages at 16 pilot sites in Indiana was evaluated. Settings were urban and rural and included comprehensive high schools and vocational centers. Data were compiled from 8 applied mathematics and 9 applied communication teachers and from 559 students. The primary goal was to determine the effectiveness of applied academics curriculum materials in integrating academics and boosting academic achievement and occupational preparation in secondary schools. Teachers and students completed questionnaire survey forms; teachers completed evaluations of the applied materials as they used the modules/units; and participating students and comparison groups of students completed either the applied communications assessment  or mathematics achievement assessment as pre- and post-tests. The applied mathematics control and experimental groups reported gains from pre- to posttesting, 3.02 and 7.06, respectively. The applied mathematics group outperformed the control group in all but one of seven goals. The applied communications students reported an overall gain of 17 percent; positive gains were recorded in each of eight modules tested. (Appendixes, amounting to almost three-fourths of the report, include site descriptions, student survey data, and results of the evaluations of the applied mathematics and applied communication modules.)

In the 1994-1995 and the 1995-1996 school years the Generalizable Mathematics Skills Assessment was administered to General Mathematics and Applied Mathematics 1 students as both the pretest and posttest to measure the gain in generalizable mathematics skills. During the study, 151 subjects were tested in three rural Oklahoma comprehensive secondary schools to provide data for the study. The research question was, are there significant differences in the gains in the total mathematics scores, in the calculation of whole numbers, fractions, decimals, percentages,  mixed operations, measurements, or in the estimation of mathematics answers between the students who completed General Mathematics and the students who completed Applied Mathematics 1 as measured by the Generalizable Mathematics Skills Assessment instrument?

Three suggested courses, centered on the topics of optimization, graph theory and combinatorics, and fluid mechanics, are outlined with references and sample problems; (2) A greater number of realistic applications from a greater variety of fields should be introduced into the mathematics courses of the first two years; (3) Every student whose degree includes  a substantial number of mathematics courses should take at least one course in applied mathematics. This recommendation applies to prospective secondary school mathematics teachers as well as mathematics majors; and (4) An undergraduate concentration in applied mathematics should be offered if the resources of the college permit.

        "description":"This study examined the role and development of applied problem solving in mathematics education in the Finnish comprehensive school. The development during the 1980s of applied problem solving in schools was positive in many ways: the changes were cautious and took place more slowly than had been planned; and many obstacles related to the organization of instruction, the curriculum, and the teaching culture constrained a faster and more far-reaching development. In the early 1980s, applied problem solving was intended to be realized mainly by increasing the number of applied tasks, and the way that both pure mathematics and applications connected with these applied tasks was examined in each content area. In the late 1980s, applied problem solving was utilized more often and in  more versatile ways. The increase in application tasks and realistic problems in teaching was also reflected in the fact that students' achievement improved slightly in these kinds of tasks. In 1990, most teachers found it easier to adopt applied problem solving as an important part of their mathematics teaching. (Contains 100 references.) (MKR)",

        "description":"This article discusses the integration of history of modern applied mathematics in mathematics education as well as the possible teaching and learning benefits of introducing a newer history of mathematics over an old(er) one--something that seems to be done most often when integrating history. Three cases of the history of modern applied mathematics (or modern applications of mathematics) are presented and later discussed in terms of their possible contributions to the use of \"history as a goal\" and \"history as a tool\". As a means for further illustration of this, empirical data from concrete implementations of two of the cases are also presented and discussed.",
