Chapter One provides an overview of the unit, a review of behavioral objectives, and a list of concepts and generalizations. The second chapter cites a teaching-learning plan dealing with such aspects of ecology as animal movement, seed dispersal, and erosion. Sample lesson plans in the final chapter contain information on behavioral objectives, teaching strategies, suggested activities, and resource materials. (CL)",

        "description":"Given the potential of afterschool programs to support youth in urban, low-income communities, we examined the role of afterschool classroom ecology in the academic outcomes of Latino and African American youth with and without social-behavioral risk. Using multireporter methods and multilevel analysis, we find that positive classroom ecology (i.e., social dynamics, responsive instruction, and organized management) positively predicted academic skills and self-concept across 1 year. For academic skills, the association was magnified for students &quot;with&quot; social-behavioral difficulties; for academic self-concept, the association was magnified for students &quot;without&quot; social-behavioral difficulties. No significant relation was found between fall classroom ecology and spring academic engagement; yet in classrooms with more positive ecology, youth with initial social-behavioral risk were more academically engaged. Results suggest the need to consider the role of afterschool classrooms and instructors in promoting supportive interactions and advancing academic outcomes for youth facing distal and proximal risk at the transition to adolescence.",

Unlike competition and predation, however, the concept of group living does not translate well to small-scale experiments involving only a few individuals. How can inquiry be used to examine why animals live in groups? The answer is  to use models, which are more feasible than working with hundreds of test subjects. This article describes a Standards-based directed inquiry into overwintering biology and behavioral ecology titled \"Awesome Aggregations\" that high school students can carry out with models of monarch butterflies to examine their adaptive value.

This essay places these contributions in the context of Darwin's life, showing his long-standing interest in psychological and behavioral issues encompassing all species, including humans. Ten areas are highlighted: natural history; communication; sexual selection and courtship; comparative cognition; emotion; instinct and behavioral development; inheritance of behavior; phylogeny of behavior; sociobiology and behavioral ecology; and applied animal behavior, animal welfare, and conservation. Several newer emphases that Darwin anticipated are briefly discussed. Darwin, while not always correct by current standards, crucially aided the process of firmly embedding psychological phenomena in a naturalistic scientific ethos.",

Comparisons between groups revealed that while the nature of instruction was similar for students regardless of behavioral competence, students in the lower behavioral competence group spent more time engaged in inappropriate behaviors and received more teacher disapproval. No differences were found in total academic responding time for high, middle, and low behavioral competence students. Findings related to the breakdown of  time in a typical school day, variability among students, the relationship between student responding time and achievement, and the relationship between behavioral and academic competence also are presented.
