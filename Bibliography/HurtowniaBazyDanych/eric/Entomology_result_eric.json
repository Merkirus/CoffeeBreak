        "author":["Hai-Jew, Shalin"],
        "description":"This article showcases a virtual interactive participatory design activity for building a digital entomology lab. Conceptualized as a virtual complement to a general entomology course at Kansas State University, the lab would allow learners to explore morphological aspects of insects--their various forms and functions--in order to understand various insect types. The initial instructional design required exploration of the equipment necessary for lighting and macro image capture. It also involved creating work processes that would protect the photographic images. (Contains 1 figure.)",

There are two main parts in the publication. Part I, entitled Basic Part, includes topics which an individual should know about radioisotopes and radiation. There are laboratory exercises included in this section. Some of the topics included are energy of radiation, autoradiography, health physics; docontamination, and activation analysis. Part II, entitled Applied Part, consists of detailed laboratory exercises in the use of isotopes and radiation in entomology. The publication should be useful for conducting training programs in this field. (PS)",

Students learn basic concepts in this unit by applying them in a practical manner. Making an insect collection and completing an insect fact sheet enables students to compare insects. The instructor guide includes transparency masters, job sheets, activity sheets, work sheets, a butterfly model and Appendix A, information on calibrating sprayers. For ease of use, performance objectives and competencies are included at the beginning of the unit, as  well as being incorporated within each lesson. Eighty-eight references are listed. A competency profile is provided for recordkeeping. A glossary of terms used in entomology and insect control is included in the student reference. (NLA)",

Integrating service-learning, a pedagogy bridging theory and practice, into the entomology curriculum at the University of Georgia provides students an opportunity to participate in developing and implementing entomological programs for communities, both domestically and abroad. This research project seeks to develop, implement, assess, and evaluate two service-learning courses in entomology: Entomology Outreach and Service-Learning (ENTO 3900) and a study abroad course, Insect Natural History in Costa Rica: International Service-Learning (ENTO 3140-3140L). A qualitative research study was designed to assess and evaluate the courses using guidance from student reflections. Results suggest that entomological service-learning courses can be integrated with community outreach programs, both domestically and abroad, to enhance students' science content knowledge and their teaching, communication, and civic skills.",

In seven consecutive terms, undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory entomology course were divided into two groups: Group I received only lecture instruction on insect orders, while Group II was dismissed for three consecutive 50-minute lecture periods to work with auto-tutorial instructional materials on a self-paced, repeatable basis. These included slide/tape programs and written resource materials covering the same information as the Group I lectures. Participants in the auto-tutorial groups were also asked to respond to a questionnaire assessing their opinions on this method of instruction. An objective test administered to both groups indicated that Group  II students with an average auto-tutorial exposure of 90.5 minutes performed comparably to Group I students taught 150 minutes by the lecture method. The majority of Group II students expressed favorable attitudes toward the auto-tutorial method; however, a few students felt that such instruction had a dehumanizing effect. (CMV)",

        "description":"This individualized, self-paced course for training an entomology specialist was adapted from military curriculum materials for use in vocational and technical education. Completion of the course should provide students with basic information needed to accomplish the following duties of an entomology specialist: perform entomological work, apply toxic pesticides, perform control operations and preventive operations, operate and calibrate dispersal and safety equipment, maintain tools and equipment, and supervise entomology personnel. The document consists of a student workbook with objectives, assignments, review exercises and answers, volume review exercises, and a test. The workbook consists of six volumes. The first volume introduces pest management and safety, while the  second contains information about pesticides and the environment and pesticide dispersal equipment. In the third volume, pests carried by domestic animals are discussed, while in the fourth household pests such as spiders and reptiles are examined. The final chapters provide information on the collection, identification, and control of economic pests (such as stored product pests, structural pests, and ornamental and turf pests) and vertebrate and vegetative pests (rodents, bats, birds, aquatic plants, grasses, and herbaceous broadleaf plants). The course in intended for use in a laboratory or on-the-job learning situation. (KC)",
