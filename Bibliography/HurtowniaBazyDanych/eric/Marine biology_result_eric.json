Section II, &quot;Activities: Marine Chemistry, Geology, &amp; Physics,&quot; includes activities on the topics of the nitrogen cycle, beach erosion, groundwater, watersheds, and the tides. Section III, &quot;Resources,&quot; describes tutorial software, simulation software, microcomputer-based labs, and general application software that can be used in the marine biology classroom. This section also describes marine science programs found across the United States and ways in which teachers and media specialists can work together to help students gain a better understanding of the global importance of the oceans.

Each booklet lists performance objectives for the unit, lists any state-adopted texts, provides a synoptic summary of the course content, suggests activities and projects (in some cases original experiments, although most are citations of experimental descriptions in recommended texts), suggests topics for student projects or reports, indicates audiovisual materials available in the county and from other sources, and recommends reference books.
