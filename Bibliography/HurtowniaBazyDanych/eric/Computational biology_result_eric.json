Although several institutions and research groups are conducting pioneering multidisciplinary research, communication and education across fields remain a bottleneck. The opportunity is ripe for using education research-supported mechanisms of cross-disciplinary training at the intersection of mathematics, computation, and biology. This case study uses the computational apprenticeship theoretical framework to describe the efforts of a computational biology lab to rapidly prototype, test, and refine a mentorship infrastructure for undergraduate research experiences. We describe the challenges, benefits, and lessons learned, as well as the utility of the computational apprenticeship framework in supporting computational/math students learning and contributing to biology, and biologists in learning computational methods. We also explore implications for undergraduate classroom instruction and cross-disciplinary scientific communication.",

        "description":"Computational thinking is a contemporary science and engineering practice that has been introduced to the US science classrooms due to its emphasis in the &quot;Next Generation Science Standards&quot; (NGSS). However, including computational thinking into science instruction may be challenging. Therefore, for biological evolution (an essential theory within biology that spans across temporal and organizational scales), we recommend integrating computational thinking into evolution teaching to overcome misconceptions, reinforce the nature of science (NOS), and allow student embodiment (as students become emerged in their models, i.e., personification). We present a learning progression, which outlines biological evolution learning coupled with computational thinking. The defined components of computational thinking (input, integration, output, and feedback) are integrated with biology student roles. The complex nature of both teaching computational thinking and biological evolution lends toward a learning progression that identifies instructional context, computational product, and computational process and spans from simple to complex. Two major themes of biological evolution, unity and diversity have each been paired with both computational thinking and specific corresponding NGSS standards at levels of increasing complexity. There are virtually no previous studies which relate computation and evolution across scales, which paves the way for questions of importance, support, benefits, and overall student achievement in relation to the advancement of science in education.",

        "description":"Leading voices in the biological sciences have called for a transformation in graduate education leading to the PhD degree. One area commonly singled out for growth and innovation is cross-training in computational science. In 1998, the University of Tennessee (UT) founded an intercollegiate graduate program called the UT-ORNL Graduate School of Genome Science and Technology in partnership with the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Here, we report outcome data that attest to the program's effectiveness in graduating computationally enabled biologists for diverse careers. Among 77 PhD graduates since 2003, the majority came with traditional degrees in the biological sciences, yet two-thirds moved into computational or hybrid (computational-experimental) positions. We describe the curriculum of the program and how it has changed. We also summarize how the program seeks to establish cohesion between computational and experimental biologists. This type of program can respond flexibly and dynamically to unmet training needs. In conclusion, this study from a flagship, state-supported university may serve as a reference point for creating a stable, degree-granting, interdepartmental graduate program in computational biology and allied areas.",

For non-science students, an introduction to biomedical databases and their applications promotes the development of a scientifically literate population. Because typical college introductory biology laboratories do not include experiences of this type, we present a bioinformatics module that can easily be included in a 90-minute session of a biology course for both majors and non-majors. Students completing this computational, inquiry-based module observed the value of computer-assisted analysis. The module gave students an understanding of how to read files in a biological database (GenBank) and how to use a software tool (BLAST) to mine the database.",

This study explored the differences in the knowledge outcomes and reasoning processes employed by undergraduate students in an introductory biology lab as they constructed, revised, and simulated a computational model of a prokaryotic gene regulatory system. We analysed post-lesson conceptual models (n = 335) and audio-recorded small group discussions (n = 10) of students that either constructed and revised a computational model and then investigated a pre-constructed computational model or only investigated a pre-constructed computational model to determine the impact of constructing and revising a computational model. No significant differences were found between the mental models of students who constructed and revised a computational model and those who only simulated a pre-constructed computational model. However, this study demonstrated that constructing and revising a model before simulating it offered additional benefits to students by fostering deeper cognitive reasoning processes. Constructing and revising a model elicited more explanatory and evaluative reasoning and prompted students to discuss the underlying mechanisms of the biological system.",

        "description":"This study aimed to investigate senior high school students' computational thinking skills after implementing the Bioinformatics Module on molecular genetics concepts. The instructional approach used in the module is Computational Inquiry-based Teaching (CIbT). This study used a quasi-experiment method with a pretest-posttest control group design. The subjects in this study consist of 24 students in the control group and 38 students in the experimental group from a senior high school in Indonesia. The instrument used in this study is six items of computational thinking test. This module had four themes; Genetics Disease, Cancer, Forensic Science, and Evolution, conducted in 8 sessions. Each session lasted 90 minutes. The Bioinformatics Module consists of programming and databases, including unplugged computational activities and unplugged activities including coding using Python, searching in Uniprot, and using BLAST in NCBI. The CIbT has five steps: orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, and discussion. The Mann-Whitney test results showed that the p-value from N-Gain data is &lt; 0.01. So, Bioinformatics Module on molecular genetics concepts using CIbT can improve computational thinking skills of senior high school students. For further implementation, biology teachers must prepare to use the Bioinformatics Module, including biology teachers' understanding of molecular genetics and bioinformatics practices to enrich the learning experience in the Bioinformatics Module.",

        "description":"Despite STEM education communities recognizing the importance of integrating computational thinking (CT) into high school curricula, computation still remains a separate area of study in K-12 contexts. In addition, much of the research on CT has focused on creating generally agreed-upon definitions and curricula, but few studies have empirically tested assessments or used contemporary learning sciences methods to do so. In this paper, we outline the implementation of an assessment approach for a 10-day high school biology unit with computational thinking activities that examines student pre-post responses as well as responses to embedded assessments throughout the unit. Using pre-post scores, we identified students with both positive and negative gains and examined how each group's CT practices developed as they engaged with the curricular unit. Our results show that (1) students exhibited science and computational learning gains after engaging with a science unit with computational models and (2) that the use of embedded assessments and discourse analytics tools reveals how students think differently with computational tools throughout the unit.",

        "description":"Computational thinking (CT) is a thought process composed of computer science ideas and skills that can be applied to solve problems and better understand the world around us. With the increase in technology and computing, STEM disciplines are becoming interwoven with computing. In order to better prepare students for STEM careers, computational literacy needs to be developed in K-12 education. We advocate the introduction of computational literacy through the incorporation of CT in core science courses, such as biology. Additionally, at least some of this integration should be unplugged, or without computers, so that all schools can participate in developing computational literacy. These lessons integrate unplugged CT and science content to help students develop CT competencies and learn natural selection content simultaneously through a series of lessons in which unplugged CT is leveraged for natural selection learning within varying contexts. In these lessons, students engage in the creation of handwritten algorithmic explanations of natural selection. Students build CT skills while making sense of the process, resulting in converged learning about CT and science. This article presents a description of CT, the specifics of the classroom implementation and lessons, student work and outcomes, and conclusions drawn from this work.",

        "description":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods are revolutionizing biology. Their prevalence requires biologists to be increasingly knowledgeable about computational methods to manage the enormous scale of data. As such, early introduction to NGS analysis and conceptual connection to wet-lab experiments is crucial for training young scientists. However, significant challenges impede the introduction of these methods into the undergraduate classroom, including the need for specialized computer programs and knowledge of computer coding. Here, we describe a semester-long, course-based undergraduate research experience at a liberal arts college combining RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis with student-driven, wet-lab experiments to investigate plant responses to light. Students derived hypotheses based on analysis of RNA-seq data and designed follow-up studies of gene expression and plant growth. Our assessments indicate that students acquired knowledge of big data analysis and computer coding; however, earlier exposure to computational methods may be beneficial. Our course requires minimal prior knowledge of plant biology, is easy to replicate, and can be modified to a shorter, directed-inquiry module. This framework promotes exploration of the links between gene expression and phenotype using examples that are clear and tractable and improves computational skills and bioinformatics self-efficacy to prepare students for the &quot;big data&quot; era of modern biology.",

        "description":"Novel computational representations, such as simulation models of complex systems and video games for scientific discovery (Foldit, EteRNA etc.), are dramatically changing the way discoveries emerge in science and engineering. The cognitive roles played by such computational representations in discovery are not well understood. We present a theoretical analysis of the cognitive roles such representations play, based on an ethnographic study of the building of computational models in a systems biology laboratory. Specifically, we focus on a case of model-building by an engineer that led to a remarkable discovery in basic bioscience. Accounting for such discoveries requires a distributed cognition (DC) analysis, as DC focuses on the roles played by external representations in cognitive processes. However, DC analyses by and large have not examined scientific discovery, and they mostly focus on memory offloading, particularly how the &quot;use&quot; of existing external representations changes the nature of cognitive tasks. In contrast, we study discovery processes and argue that discoveries emerge from the processes of &quot;building&quot; the computational representation. The building process integrates manipulations in imagination and in the representation, creating a &quot;coupled cognitive system&quot; of model and modeler, where the model is &quot;incorporated&quot; into the modeler's imagination. This account extends DC significantly, and we present some of the theoretical and application implications of this extended account.",

        "description":"Our paper describes a solution we found to a still existing need to develop mathematical modeling courses for undergraduate biology majors. Some challenges of such courses are: (i) relatively limited exposure of biology students to higher-level mathematical and computational concepts; (ii) availability of texts that can give a flavor of how contemporary biological problems are approached with quantitative methods; (iii) expectations to cover specific mathematical (or biological) content rather than teach a problem-solving approach. We solved these challenges by designing a course where several modules were developed, each beginning with a presentation from a campus expert in a biological area of research and concluding with a seminar-style student-led paper presentation of an article that addresses the biological problem using mathematical and computational tools. The aim of the course was to expose students to the vast possibilities and potential in quantitative biology, and to give them a vocabulary to collaborate with mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists.",

        "description":"Scientific advances in genetic analysis have been made possible in recent years by technical developments in computational biology, or bioinformatics. Bioinformatics has opened up the human genome to diverse analyses involving automated laboratory hardware and machine learning algorithms and software. As part of an emerging field of social genomics, recent educational genetics studies using big data have begun to raise challenging findings linking DNA to predicted life outcomes. Bioinformatic technologies and techniques including 'genome-wide association' and 'polygenic scoring' are producing new kinds of genetic biodata and expert knowledge for rethinking the upbringing and education of children. This article takes as an empirical opening a recent epistemic and ethical controversy over the use of biodata to make genetic predictions about educational, socio-economic and life outcomes, detailing the forms of expert knowledge and technologies involved these predictions, and exploring the social and ethical implications of data-intensive bioinformatics.",

Here, we present a computational laboratory where the capacity of each of the 20 amino acids to maintain different noncovalent interactions are used to investigate the stabilizing forces in a set of proteins coming from organisms adapted to different environments. Using protein sequence and structure information it is possible to evaluate the noncovalent contributions to the stabilization of a given protein fold. As a case study, we use the protein lumazine synthase from three different organisms adapted to live in extreme temperatures: one psychrophilic (optimal growth temperature, 0-20 degrees C), one mesophilic (optimal growth temperature, 20-50 degrees C), and one thermophilic (optimal growth temperature, 80-110 degrees C). We found that this computational laboratory for biochemistry and molecular biology courses enhances student amino acid noncovalent interaction understanding and how these interactions are involved in protein stability.
