        "description":"Debates and policies in the late 1950s and early 1960s regarding the United States-Soviet space race are described in this paper, and an analysis is presented of press coverage of President John F. Kennedy's public statements regarding space technology and exploration. The first sections of the paper present a selected space chronology from 1957 to 1975, describe debates that occurred between 1957 and 1961 regarding the proper role for the U.S. in view of Russia's successes in space exploration, show how increasing pressure was placed on Kennedy in 1960 and 1961 to make a critical decision about the U.S. space program, and tell how efforts were begun between the Soviets in space. The paper then reports on an analysis of the coverage by three major U.S. newspapers of 11 public  statements in which Kennedy referred to space technology and exploration and also to the Soviet Union. Among the conclusions reported are: (1) there was no obvious relationship between newspaper coverage of space-related issues and the space-related issues discussed by Kennedy; (2) Kennedy emphasized U.S. space efforts and U.S.-Soviet space cooperation, while the newspapers focused on Soviet space achievements and on the U.S.-Soviet space race; and (3) most newspeper items mentioned national prestige.

        "description":"The U.S. civilian space program is focused on planning for a new round of human missions to the Moon and, later, perhaps, to Mars. These plans are intended to realize a \"vision\" for exploration articulated by President George W. Bush. It is important to examine this \"vision\" in the broader context of 21st-century space exploration, which is a truly global enterprise. Questions to be addressed include the following: How will extending human presence into the solar system affect society and culture on Earth? What legal, ethical, and other value systems should govern human settlements and other activities in space? Do humans have rights to exploit extraterrestrial resources and alter extraterrestrial environments? Does space exploration need reinvention to meet social needs? This article describes the current environment for space policy making and a framework of space law, ethics, and culture within which these questions can be considered. (Contains 17 notes.)",

The possibility of going into space and subsequent moon landings have encouraged the government and scientists to formulate future plans in this field. Brief descriptions (mostly informative in nature) of these plans provide an account of future challenges and impact on life situations. The Apollo program will culminate in a Skylab meant to gather information about space and the planets. The Skylab should lead to setting up a permanent space station. Later probes of planets, especially Venus, will provide information that might prove very useful in the study of the universe. (PS)",

These vehicles--the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles--are part of the Constellation Program, which is carrying out a bold vision of human space exploration. The program also includes a crew exploration vehicle. The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 directs NASA to establish a program to develop a sustained human presence on the Moon, which will serve as a stepping stone to further exploration of Mars and other destinations. This design challenge focuses on the Ares family of launch vehicles, which will replace the Space Shuttle orbiter in the task of putting people, satellites, and scientific experiments into space.
