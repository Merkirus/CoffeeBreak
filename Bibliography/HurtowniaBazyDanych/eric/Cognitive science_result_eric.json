Areas discussed include: (1) science education as a national concern; (2) how rapid advances in science knowledge and cognitive psychological knowledge have created a sense of urgency about developing a modern &quot;science of science education&quot;; and (3) the impact of cognitive psychology on science and mathematics education. Considered in the latter area are: a framework for a science of science education, advances in cognitive psychology important for a science of science education, findings from cognitive psychology of interest to curriculum developers and teacher educators (including the development of alternative conceptions), and likely  concerns of cognitive psychology, such as research on the organization of the mind, which may have a profound impact on the science of science education.

Additional purposes were to identify common and unique elements in these composite cognitive styles and to substantiate the description of the groups of successful and unsuccessful science students according to the variables: science achievement, knowledge of the processes of science, and attitude toward science. Sex differences were also considered. The sample included 351 tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade students. Each student was administered the Test of Academic Progress, the Wisconsin Inventory of Science Processes, and an adaptation of the Hartman Science Attitude Test. The cognitive style of each individual was mapped using the Cognitive  Style Mapping Booklet. Statistical analysis showed significant differences for nine sets of variables, including: (1) achievement in science for successful and unsuccessful science students; (2) cognitive styles of successful and unsuccessful science students at the secondary level; (3) cognitive styles of male and female successful and unsuccessful students; and (4) cognitive styles of successful and unsuccessful science students at different grade levels in the secondary school.

This document reports the results of a workshop designed to provide advice to the National Science Foundation regarding plans for achieving the potential of cognitive science in the 21st century. The report is separated into three sections. The introduction presents three directions in which cognitive science can be developed: (1) the sciences of agents interacting in social and physical environments; (2) the science of individual agents; and (3) the sciences of natural processes. The second section presents  brief discussions of a sample of research topics that are active foci of work in cognitive science. Research topics include language, conceptual knowledge, abstract neural networks, and analyses of cognitive activity in social and physical environments. The third section discusses recommendations for enhancing research in the cognitive sciences. Recommendations include: (1) extending the working corps of interdisciplinary cognitive scientists; (2) utilizing technology resource for collaboration with new methodologies and across disciplines; (3) enhancing institutional structures in support of interdisciplinary research; and (4) funding levels.
