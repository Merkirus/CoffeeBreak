        "description":"Computational and atmospheric chemistry are two important branches of contemporary chemistry. With the present topical nature of climate change and global warming, it is more crucial than ever that students are aware of and exposed to atmospheric chemistry, with an emphasis on how modeling may aid in understanding how atmospherically relevant chemical compounds interact with incoming solar radiation. Nonetheless, computational and atmospheric chemistry are under-represented in most undergraduate chemistry curricula. In this manuscript, we describe a simple and efficient method for simulating the electronic absorption spectral profiles of atmospherically relevant molecules that may be utilized in an undergraduate computer laboratory. The laboratory results give students hands-on experience in computational and atmospheric chemistry, as well as electronic absorption spectroscopy.",

In this study, we evaluated the presence of this and other misconceptions surrounding atmospheric chemistry that are responsible for the entanglement of the greenhouse effect and the ozone hole in students' conceptual frameworks. We then designed a series of computer-based online data-analysis exercises to address this shortcoming and measured the effectiveness of these instructional materials in a first-year general chemistry class. Based on pre- and post-activity assessments, students demonstrated a moderate improvement in their conceptual understanding from the online exercises alone, and student performance was greatly enhanced when the online exercises were supported with both lecture and small-group discussion activities. The integration of individual online learning and data analysis with these more traditional methods of instruction allowed students to address their prior misconceptions and ultimately construct a more scientifically accurate understanding of atmospheric environmental chemistry.

Most research in this area used survey methodologies and did not include concepts of atmospheric chemistry and ozone formation. This study investigates college students' understandings of atmospheric ozone formation using established clinical interview methodologies and qualitative data analysis techniques. Three prevalent naive conceptions were identified: (1) that there is only one atmospheric mechanism for ozone formation; (2) that pollutants and gases only react after being transported up high in the atmosphere; and (3) that concerns about ozone in the atmosphere are due primarily to its role as a greenhouse gas. The existence of these naive conceptions prevented students from forming correct mental models of atmospheric ozone formation. Existing conceptual change approaches may provide pathways for addressing these naive conceptions, but further research is required before specific solutions are proposed.

        "author":["Wagner, Eugene P.",
          "Murray, Bridget E."],
        "description":"Chemistry of the environment has been a long-standing and important area of scientific research. Atmospheric chemistry is of particular interest in society due to the impact that rising levels of pollutants are having on the climate. It is well-known that combustion processes create CO and NO[subscript x], which leads to the creation of other pollutants, such as ozone and CO[subscript 2]. There are natural processes, such as lightning, that also create a significant amount of pollutant gases. The purpose of this guided and open inquiry laboratory experiment is to provide an opportunity for students to investigate how lightning may produce pollutant gases in the atmosphere. In the guided inquiry experiment, a sealed IR gas cell containing air is exposed to a spark or corona discharge created by an Oudin coil to mimic lightning. IR spectroscopy is used to monitor the reaction progress and identify new species made after exposure to the electrical discharge. Based on the results, students draw conclusions about what types of gases are created in the two different discharge processes and how lightning may contribute to atmospheric pollutants. Students move on to the open inquiry to further investigate aspects of atmospheric gases, where they develop their own hypothesis and methods based on one of the provided suggestions, such as the effect of spark and corona discharge on pure oxygen, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide gases, the kinetics of ozone creation and decay, and the temperature dependence of NO[subscript 2] dimerization. Although designed for an honors general chemistry course, this experiment can be adapted for second-semester general chemistry, environmental chemistry, analytical, and physical chemistry laboratory courses. Results from these experiments are presented, and the relevant atmospheric chemical processes are discussed. The impact of this experiment on perceived gains in knowledge, the value of inclusion in the curriculum, and the design of the experiment were assessed, and the results are discussed.",

Subject matter moves from a review of the relevant chemical and meteorological principles to a discussion of the general methods of obtaining and handling air chemical data. Three classes of chemical compounds (sulphur, nitrogen, and carbon) which are important in any consideration of trace constitutuents of the atmosphere are examined. Significant atmospheric reactions, the global budgets, and selected methods of analysis for these compounds are considered. Also covered are some of the physical characteristics of aerosols. While some reference is made to  current research, the book cannot be considered as a research-oriented text, rather, as a utilitarian work to introduce the reader to basic air chemistry information and successful approaches to the study of air chemistry. It would be most useful in upper-level undergraduate and graduate level college courses. (BL)",
