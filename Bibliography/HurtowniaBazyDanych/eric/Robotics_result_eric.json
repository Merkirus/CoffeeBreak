        "description":"Competitive robotics as an interactive experience can increase the level of student participation in technology education, inspire students to consider careers in technical fields, and enhance the visibility of technology education programs. Implemented correctly, a competitive robotics program can provide a stimulating learning environment for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects. Implementing a local competitive robotics program is a serious undertaking, though partnering with an established national or regional competitive robotics organization can offer a significant advantage. Robotics organizations that engage middle school or high school students generally conduct an annual competitive event that requires the team members to develop a strategy to solve some type of problem or complete a &quot;mission.&quot; A wide selection of good competitive robotics organizations operate currently, and they are dedicated to bringing excitement to technology education through their competitions. The authors have selected some organizations and programs to illustrate the variety of characteristics to consider when selecting a competitive robotics partner organization: BEST Robotics, Botball Educational Robotics, FIRST Robotics Competition (FIRST/FRC), FIRST Lego League (FIRST/FLL), Robofest, National Robotics Challenge (NRC), and EARLY Robotics. An overview of the selected organizations is presented. (Contains 4 online resources.)",

Background: Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that includes mechanical engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, and computer science. Several universities have established departments of robotics to teach their students robotics education; however, a comprehensive curriculum to deliver robotics education has not yet been fully developed. Research Questions: What are the significant component courses offered by existing departments of robotics? Methodology: This article investigates component courses among departments of robotics through a title-based aggregation of existing courses and textual analyses. Findings: From a title-based aggregation of robotics curricula from 19 departments established by 2018, control engineering, programming, technical drawing/design, and electronic engineering/electronic circuits were found to be the core courses. From textual analyses of the curricula, robotics departments' course titles were similar to those of mechanical engineering departments.",

The robotics curriculum exposed senior-level undergraduate students to major robotics concepts, and enhanced the student learning experience in hybrid learning environments by incorporating the IEEE Region-5 annual robotics competition with open-ended design challenges, by establishing a robotics club, and by implementing a K-12 mentorship program. A four-faculty team developed two elective courses in which the theoretical concepts underlying the robotics design competition topics were supported with corresponding laboratory activities. Students took the courses sequentially. They were formed into diverse teams, whose performance was assessed via weekly team presentations and participation in an outreach day. The best robot design teams participated in the IEEE Region-5 competitions. All students participated in a service-learning activity, acting as mentors during local K-12 robotics competitions while enhancing their own robotics comprehension. The robotics curriculum's two-year evaluation results illustrate the consistent efficacy of the curriculum during the project duration, indicating a successful robotics educational model for other academic institutions to follow.",

        "description":"Teaching educational robotics is of growing interest in K-12 settings. Yet, immense efforts are needed to move the field forward by framing the teaching of robotics with pedagogically sound theories as well as appropriate instructional design models and strategies. To meet this need, the authors designed and implemented an online educational robotics course for inservice teachers who had little or no prior experience in teaching robotics, by applying instructional design factors as well as teaching and facilitation strategies derived from the learning by design (LBD) framework. Action research employing mixed methods was carried out to examine the effects of instructional design factors implemented in the online educational robotics course. An online survey indicated that the participating teachers increased their self-efficacy in robotics, use of problem-solving and collaboration strategies, and confidence in robotics knowledge and teaching. In addition, by the end of the course, the participating teachers demonstrated sufficient robotics content knowledge. As revealed in their reflective essays, they also developed learning strategies, such as case-based reasoning, sketches, trial and error, and evaluating capacity while completing the robotics open-ended project. Further, they realized the constraints of learning educational robotics online and the benefits of collaboration. This study sheds light on the design components of a robotics course grounded in LBD that are effective for preparing teachers in an online environment to implement robotics in their classrooms.",

        "description":"Educational robotics activities are gaining in popularity. Though some research data suggest that educational robotics can be an effective approach in teaching mathematics, science, and engineering, research is needed to generate the best practices and strategies for designing these learning environments. Existing robotics activities typically do not provide a rich story context to motivate students. This preliminary study explores the use of fictional narrative in robotics activities. It describes the narrative that establishes a context for the activities, examines the design of the robotics challenges, and presents student and teacher perceptions of the narrative. The results of this research provide suggestions for future improvement of robotics activities. They may inform teachers and researchers interested in integrating robotics into various formal and informal learning environments. (Contains 3 figures.)",

        "description":"Nowadays robotics is one of promising avenues in the sphere of emerging technologies. In the teaching/learning environment we deal with educational robotics, which is a mixture of theory and practice, knowledge of computer technology, Mathematics and Physics. The two vectors are combined in educational robotics: the educational vector and the technological vector. As an academic discipline and an area of practical application, Robotics means a very broad spectrum of modern knowledge of diverse academic engineering specialties (fields of expertise). That means that Robotics is interdisciplinary in nature. The work provides an overview of the research aimed at studying Robot -- Man interaction. Besides, the work considers some promising international cooperation between children from around the world on the development of robotics, and the experience and benefits gained from such cooperation. As an example of the international cooperation in the sphere of Robotics, the two countries, Russia and Kazakhstan, are considered. The article gives an example of the international cooperation of some educational centers, describes the experience of the work on robotics with children of various ages, and the cooperation of various schools working in this field in Kazakhstan and Russia. The working experience in the sphere of social robotics aimed at helping people has become a priority for the children from the interdisciplinary teams from Russia and Kazakhstan. Interaction and cooperation in the sphere of robotics was also used for introducing unconventional curricula, which included courses on robotic technologies as tools for considering social aspects of robotics and artificial intelligence.",

Some of them refer to robotics education, rather than educational robotics. Others follow a constructionist approach, but give emphasis only to design skills, creativity and collaboration. Some studies use robotics as an educational tool in engineering education, science and programming learning implying mindtools, but they do not give evidence of mindtool characteristics. This work proposes educational robotics as mindtools based on constructivism and especially constructionism. The positive learning results from two case studies on physics and programming teaching indicate that educational robotics can be used as mindtools supporting knowledge construction through the design of meaningful authentic projects, learning by doing in both the virtual and real world, facing cognitive conflicts and learning by reflection and collaboration.",

Robotics offers a playful and tangible way for children to engage with both T and E concepts during their foundational early childhood years. This study looks at N = 60 children in pre-kindergarten through second grade who completed an 8-week robotics curriculum in their classrooms using the KIWI robotics kit combined with a tangible programming language. Children were assessed on their knowledge of foundational robotics and programming concepts upon completion of the curriculum. Results show that beginning in pre-kindergarten, children were able to master basic robotics and programming skills, while the older children were able to master increasingly complex concepts using the same robotics kit in the same amount of time. Implications for developmentally appropriate design of technology, as well as structure and pace of robotics curricula for young children are addressed.",

Robotics is thus a core course in system and control-related engineering education. This paper summarizes the experience of developing robotics courses presented in the literature and shares the author's experiences through many years of teaching and developing robotics courses with other educators in the Department of Mechatronics, Chungnam National University (CNU), Daejeon, Korea. First, the CNU robotics course described here has classroom and laboratory sections. In class, students learn the theories behind robotics and practice them by performing simulation studies. In parallel, students perform robotics exercises in the laboratory. Second, the lab exercises are focused on hands-on experiments on robot systems; these include an experimental kit, LEGO robots, humanoid robots, industrial robots, and home service robots. Third, competition-based learning is explored by assigning a class project to develop a boxing robot, which covers both manipulation and mobility. Finally, the course introduces robotics-associated outreach activities. The analysis of several years of student evaluation is presented.",

        "description":"COVID-19 presented a challenge to the traditional methods of teaching programming and robotics in a secondary school environment. When campuses were closed around the world in the spring of 2020, it was not possible for students to access the computer labs nor the robotics equipment that was traditionally used to facilitate the instruction of robotics programming units. This paper presents a design research project in which two secondary institutions in Canada and Turkey collaborated to teach computer science and robotics programming, specifically reinforcement learning, through the use of an online simulation environment. The two student cohorts in the study both were successful in developing reinforcement learning models for autonomous vehicles, despite not having any prior experience in machine learning nor artificial intelligence. The implications of this work are that physical robotics kits and dedicated robotics spaces are not essential to the teaching of programming and robotics. This is especially relevant to marginalized communities that do not have the resources to support robotics instruction, further exacerbating the digital divide.",

        "description":"July 22-23, 2005 the Indiana Robotics Invitational (IRI) was held at Lawrence North High school in Indianapolis. The IRI began in Indiana in May 2000 with 20 teams. The first invitational was nicknamed the &quot;Hoosier Havoc.&quot; The event was coordinated by FIRST robotics team #45 (the Techno-Kats) from Kokomo, Indiana. Today, the former Hoosier Havoc is known as the highly regarded Indiana Robotics Invitational. Nearly 60 FIRST robotics teams from across the United States and Canada compete in this exciting event. Students learn firsthand how to use Technology, Innovation, Design, and Engineering (TIDE) as well as become experienced in how to apply concepts from science, math, and invention. In Indiana, the IRI is supported by universities, corporations, and businesses to help the students determine future career and academic goals. In addition to the FIRST robotics, a new opportunity for this year's IRI was the pilot of the Vex Challenge. Vex is a mid-level robotics competition that is aimed at providing similar opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.",

        "description":"This study aims to explore the usability of the virtual robotics programming curriculum (VRP-C) for robotics programming teaching. Pre-service computer science (CS) teachers were trained for robotics programming teaching by using VRP-C in a scientific education activity. After training, views of the participants were revealed by using a scale and an evaluation form consisting of open-ended questions. Results show that VRP-C is compatible with the curriculum for robotics programming teaching in schools, and pre-service CS teachers tend to use VRP-C in their courses. They think that VRP-C will be beneficial for robotics programming teaching in terms of content, functionality, and cost. Compatibility, visual design, feedback, time management, fiction, gamification, and cost are the characteristics that increase the usability of VRP-C. VRP-C can be used as an online tool for robotics programming training due to the necessity of transition to distance education because of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
