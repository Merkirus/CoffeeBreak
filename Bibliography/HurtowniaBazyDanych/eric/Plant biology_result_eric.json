        "description":"A survey instrument was sent to all doctorate-granting institutions and all institutions identified as offering doctorates in plant biology. Doctorate-granting institutions were identified using the U.S. Department of Education's Higher Education General Information Surveys (HEGIS) listings. Responses were received from plant biology program representatives at 197 of 198 institutions (99 percent). A total of 154 institutions were identified as offering graduate training in plant biology. Questions that were included in the 1983 and 1989 questionnaires concerned these issues: (1) the number of full-time faculty, postdoctoral fellows/associates, Ph.D. recipients, and full-time graduate students in plant biology; (2) the departments involved in providing graduate instruction in  plant biology and the number of plant biology faculty in each department; (3) the number of foreign graduate students and postdoctorates in plant biology; (4) the three major disciplines within plant biology for graduate student training, postdoctoral research and training, and faculty research; (5) faculty vacancies in plant biology; (6) disciplines with surpluses or shortages of positions in various employment categories; (7) the major sources of financial support for graduate students and postdoctorates; and (8) the amount and sources of outside funding for plant biology research. A new question was added in 1989 that asked what factors are limiting progress in plant biology. Also, new data were collected on faculty with bachelor's degrees from foreign institutions, and financial data  separating Hatch funds from other outside sources of funds. Unless stated otherwise, all statistics presented in this report are results from the 1983 and 1989 surveys. In general, statistics in this report are presented both as overall totals and using four major categories: institutional control (public/private), research size (based on federally financed research and development expenditures in the life science), number of full-time plant biology faculty (based on responses to the questionnaires), and geographic region (Northeast, Central, Southeast, West). More detailed discussion of the research methodology and a copy of the 1989 survey questionnaire are included in Appendixes B and C respectively. (KR)",

        "description":"This study aims to assess learning outcomes and identify students' misconceptions in plant classification. We conducted a questionnaire survey with undergraduate and master's students. The qualitative analysis of the students' responses made it possible to shed light on the difficulties of assimilation of many notions and also to identify the different misconceptions constructed during their learning courses about plant organisms. The findings indicate that some students are not motivated to take the course on plant classification. This demotivation is reinforced further by students' perceptions of plant classification, especially that it is not important and not useful for learning other biology specialities. The findings also show that more than half of the students who participated in this study consider plant systematics a difficult subject. We also note that some of the students surveyed seem not to have acquired many concepts of plant biology including concepts related to the biology, reproduction and evolution of plants. Thanks to this, we could see different types of problems in plant classification, which constitute misconceptions hindering learning. Initial training in plant biology does not appear to have a significant effect in modifying students' misconceptions related to plant classification.",

        "description":"This experiment combines analytical techniques of solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with easily relatable and accessible plant volatile chemistry (floral and vegetative scents of local/available plants). The biosynthesis and structure of these chemicals are of interest in the areas of organic chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology. This laboratory exercise is well-suited for a broad range of cross-disciplinary topics in chemistry and biology courses. The methods described here could be used to expose undergraduate chemistry students to broad aspects of biological volatile chemistry in plants, and alternatively, to expose undergraduate biology students to analytical chemistry techniques useful in the study of plant biology and plant-insect interactions.",
