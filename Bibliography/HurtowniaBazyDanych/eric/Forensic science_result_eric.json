        "title":"Education and Training in Forensic Science: A Guide for Forensic Science Laboratories, Educational Institutions, and Students. Special Report.",
        "description":"Forensic science provides scientific and foundational information for investigators and courts, and thus plays a crucial role in the criminal justice system. This guide was developed through the work of the Technical Working Group on Education and Training in Forensic Science (TWGED) to serve as a reference on best education and training practices for students pursing careers in forensic science; for forensic science laboratories as an aide in the hiring and training of forensic scientists; and for educational institutions offering or striving to establish forensic science programs. The introduction discusses how to use the document and presents relevant definitions, as well as an outline of the planning process for the guide. The next section outlines the qualifications for a career in forensic science and describes the personal characteristics, the academic qualifications, and the professional skills of the model candidate. Tips are offered on career success in forensic science at each level: pre-employment preparation; on-the-job training; certification; and professional involvement. The next section describes the undergraduate curriculum students interested in forensic science should pursue. The model curriculum involves a natural science core and specialized science courses, a forensic science core and forensic science laboratory courses, as well as additional courses selected by the student to add depth in their chosen area of concentration. The main points to ensuring curriculum success are enumerated. The following section describes the graduate curriculum for students of forensic science, which involves courses in the following topics: crime scenes, physical evidence, law/science interface, ethics, and quality assurance. Expectations on research skills, communications skills, and laboratory requirements and experience are discussed. The last section describes training and continuing education in forensic science; model criteria and core elements are enumerated for training programs and courses for continuing professional development. Tips are offered for gaining the most from training programs and continuing professional development courses.",

Building on the interest of popular television shows such as &quot;CSI&quot; and &quot;Breaking Bad,&quot; this course connects essential concepts in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, organic chemistry, and general chemistry with criminal justice studies to kindle student interest using the forensic science theme. Available to students in criminal justice or natural science majors, the forensic science theme is the focus as students participate in interdisciplinary activities and discussions while exploring fundamental principles used to solve crimes. Requiring critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, the collaboration of students of different academic focus leads to the debunking of myths surrounding both police and forensic scientists, while developing an awareness of how law enforcement and scientists work together in reality.",

        "author":["Rushton, Catherine Genice"],
        "description":"The National Institute of Justice (1999) and the National Academy of Sciences (2009) recommended that forensic science training shift from on-the-job training to formal education; however, the reports cited inconsistencies in the curricula of the forensic science degree programs as an impediment to this. The Forensic Science Education Programs Accreditation Commission (FEPAC) Standards were created to address this issue; however, no studies have been conducted to determine how the accreditation standards have been implemented by the FEPAC accredited graduate programs. This study evaluated the self-study responses (n = 11) and website information (n = 17) specific to FEPAC's Graduate Curriculum Standard to determine how the graduate programs fulfilled the FEPAC Graduate Curriculum Standard. This study also determined to what extent inconsistencies or consistencies exist among the accredited graduate programs' curricula. This study found that although FEPAC Accredited Graduate Forensic Science Programs exhibited differences (unique characteristics) among their curricula, they did not as whole exhibit significant inconsistencies (lack of agreement). All the graduate programs covered the natural sciences particularly as the areas related to forensic science, such as forensic chemistry and forensic biology. However, the programs' coverage of the comparative sciences, such as firearms and questioned documents was limited. Evaluation of the eleven FEPAC self-study reports revealed that on average these programs exceeded the required ten instructional hours specified by FEPAC as core forensic science topics required of all accredited graduate forensic science programs. All programs in this study required students to complete an independent research project as their capstone experience whether thesis or non-thesis. Additionally, all programs included a requirement for students to attend graduate seminar where students presented their independent research findings. Admissions requirements were similar for all programs with the exception of the prerequisite courses required for entry into the graduate program. The study found the FEPAC Accredited Graduate Forensic Science Programs' curricula consistent with unique characteristics among the graduate programs. The curricula were rigorous, scientific-based, and discipline specific. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

        "description":"Forensic science education has evolved as an interdisciplinary science that includes medicine, chemistry, biology, and criminal justice. Therefore, multiple paths can lead to a career in forensic science. A formal education usually requires the student to attend a college or university to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree. In many cases, professionals working in the field of forensic science have a bachelor's degree in a natural science and learn hands-on, in an operational laboratory, the skills necessary to perform the required tasks applied in a forensics laboratory. To advance their knowledge or obtain a master's degree, students would traditionally have to put their career on hold to attend a college or university. Because forensic scientists are in high demand in the United States and around the world, the International Forensic Science Distance Education program at the University of Florida takes a novel approach to provide the theoretical knowledge necessary for a master's degree, enabling students to stay on the job and in touch with the practical application of their discipline. This article introduces the program and its application to college distance education programs in the natural sciences. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)",
