          "Schiebel, Tracee M."],
        "description":"Researchers and pollsters still debate the acceptance of genetic engineering technology among U.S. adults, and continue to assess their knowledge as part of this research. While decision-making may not rely entirely on knowledge, querying opinions and perceptions rely on public understanding of genetic engineering terms. Experience with agriculture may increase familiarity with genetic engineering terms. We conducted a national survey of 429 United States adults through Qualtrics and found two-thirds lack any formal, nonformal, or informal agriculture experience. More than half of participants knew &quot;a little&quot; or less for 13 of the 17 terms presented, especially those directly related to genetic engineering or breeding technology for food, such as &quot;genetically modified organism&quot; and &quot;crossbred organism.&quot; Consumers with agricultural experience reported more term familiarity for genetics and genetic engineering than those without experience. More than half also felt they did not know the difference between traditional selective breeding, DNA-directed breeding, and genetic engineering, but they still felt both human health and environmental risks should be considered before creating new animal or plant varieties. We must consider the lack of familiarity of genetic-related terms and experience in agriculture when researching or creating educational programming around genetic engineering for food.",

        "author":["Jordahl, Ron, Ed."],
        "description":"This document reports a survey instituted to compare the attitudes of students at a Christian college (Prairie Bible College) in Alberta, Canada with those of college students in general concerning the possible use of genetic manipulation. Comparison was made with the findings of a 1990 study by Geremia Veglia, et al., &quot;Public Attitudes toward Human Genetic Manipulation: A Revitalization or Eugenics?&quot; (ED 327 408). The survey was divided into three parts: (1) one measuring the response and acceptance of genetic engineering; (2) the second measuring the response and attitudes toward negative eugenics; and (3) one seeing what, if any, social opinions could influence or rationalize their participation in genetic engineering. These parts of the survey employed the same questions as  the study by Veglia. A fourth part was added to measure whether the academic program, length of Christian college study, age, sex, marital status, and parenting had any influence on opinions about genetic engineering. The students at Prairie Bible College, when asked if, as prospective parents they would welcome a program to correct genetic deficiencies, disagreed or strongly disagreed at a rate of 54 percent. Males were in opposition at a rate of 57.5 percent, and females at a rate of 51 percent. This was opposed to the original Veglia survey in which 74.1 per cent of respondents would welcome such a program. The paper concludes that the Christian convictions of the subjects made them much more opposed to genetic manipulation than college students in general. Openness to genetic  engineering showed an inverse relationship to the amount of study completed at the Christian college. (DK)",

        "description":"Genetic engineering and biotechnology made possible of gene transfer without discriminating microorganism, plant, animal or human. However, although these scientific techniques have benefits, they cause arguments because of their ethical and social impacts. The arguments about ethical ad social impacts of biotechnology made clear that not only getting basic knowledge about biotechnology and genetic engineering, also ethical and social issues must be thought in the schools, because the level of knowledge and the attitudes of new generation is very important for the society. So, in this study it is tried to determine the university students' level of knowledge about genetic engineering and their attitude towards genetic engineering applications. For determining the students' level of knowledge and attitude about genetic engineering, a questionnaire, which includes 2 open-ended questions and Likert type attitude scale with 12 statements, is given to students and wanted to answer. Answers of the open-ended questions in the questionnaire are subjected to content analysis and students' level of knowledge about this field is tried to determine. The statements in attitude scale with 12 subjects is grouped under 3 titles; and to evaluate the answers to the statements in attitude scale, percentage values and group differentiations are calculated by SPSS. The results have shown that students do not have sufficient knowledge about basic principles of genetic engineering and their attitudes towards the applications change according to species of organisms and the objective of the study.",
