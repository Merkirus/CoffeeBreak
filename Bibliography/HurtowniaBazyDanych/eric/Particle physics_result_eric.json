        "description":"Elementary particle physics is gradually implemented into science curricula at the high school level. However, common presentations on educational, semi-technical or popular level contain or support severe misconceptions. We discuss in particular the notion of 'particle', the interaction between them and the use of Feynman diagrams. In many cases the true novelty of particle physics (i.e. quantum field theory) is largely ignored. We also suggest reasons for this widespread distortions of particle physics in popular accounts.",

The participants worked with data from real high energy particle collisions, learned about particle physics, and experienced research and education environments at European universities. In an evaluation of the masterclasses 70% of the participants reported that they learned &quot;much&quot; or &quot;very much&quot; about the organization of scientific research and more than 80% of the participants, in some countries more than 95%, highly appreciated the masterclass programme in general. The appreciation of the masterclasses was independent of gender, pre-knowledge of particle physics and computer knowledge. An event like the masterclasses, where the students are engaged in an experimental research process, has the potential to add valuable experiences to physics education in school environments.
