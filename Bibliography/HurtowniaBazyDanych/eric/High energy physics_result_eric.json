        "description":"Energy consumption in the world is increasing more and more due to the huge energy request coming from emerging countries such as China, India, etc. To face the challenge of sustainability, a solution may be the use of solar energy, since it is the most abundant renewable energy source on Earth. The electromagnetic energy coming from the Sun can be converted into usable energy (electricity) by solar cells, whose conversion efficiency is continuously increasing due to scientific and technological progress. The proposed activity is thought to be carried out with secondary as well as high school students to allow teachers to discuss sustainability issues, and to provide students with an introductory view into modern physics aspects (quantization of energy levels), quantum mechanics (semiconductor band energies), and radiation-matter interaction. Furthermore, cutting-edge research in physics can reach school students, increasing their interest in scientific studies.",

The experiment reproduces a laboratory windmill, which can pump water from a lower level to a higher one. By measuring the gain of the gravitational potential energy of the pumped water, one can determine the power extracted from the wind. The activity was carried out with high-school students, in the framework of the Italian National Plan for Scientific Degrees--Physics. The proposed experiment allows teachers to discuss renewable energy sources with students whose knowledge of physics is limited to mechanics. It gives students the possibility to gain experience with energy and to increase their awareness of this renewable energy source. (Contains 5 figures and 3 footnotes.)",

A second step addresses the quantification of kinetic energy by introducing reference units. Third, we construct a mechanical calorimeter that generates these countable energy portions. And finally, in a fourth step, a quantitative description leads to the fundamental equation, that relates kinetic energy to velocity and mass.
