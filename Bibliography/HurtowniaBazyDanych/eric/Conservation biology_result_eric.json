        "description":"The interdisciplinary science of conservation biology provides undergraduate biology students with the opportunity to connect the biological sciences with disciplines including economics, social science and philosophy to address challenging conservation issues. Because of its complexity, students do not often have the opportunity to practise conservation biology. To increase exposure to this science, this paper describes a virtual rainforest island on which students collect data related to forest carbon storage, while also confronting ethical issues. Students are asked to independently make decisions, collect data and explore the island before writing a research report with recommendations for the future management of the island's forests. The ethics of decision-making are addressed in the students' research reports and are reinforced through guided class discussion. Students will complete this activity with increased ethical awareness, as well as a better understanding of the challenges associated with the practise of conservation biology.",

        "description":"The study investigated the attitudes of Biology teachers and students toward conservation of natural resources in Ekiti State. The participants for this study were 50 Biology teachers and 100 Biology students. The selection was based on purposive sampling technique which involved 10 secondary schools. Data collected from teachers' and students on conservation of Natural Resources Questionnaire were analyzed using frequency counts, percentage, mean, standard deviation and t-test. The findings indicated that both teachers and students had a good knowledge of natural resources conservation concepts. The attitudes of both teachers and students point more to positive than negative. On a general note, the teachers had higher mean scores than the students indicating that teachers tended to have more favourable attitudes than the students toward natural resources conservation. It is recommended therefore, that the Federal and State environmental protection agencies should continue to make schools their principal focus in their bids to create, promote and sustain public awareness of the importance of natural resources conservation to mankind.",

Since this methodology requires extensive and well-documented literature searching, it is beneficial for information professionals to understand disciplinary developments in its use. This article investigates trends in systematic review publication in conservation biology journals between 1998 and 2017 and examines the prevalence of search reporting among these systematic reviews. Results show an increase in published systematic reviews over the study period, and the majority of these include a description of the literature search. However, evidence of variable search quality and reporting indicates an important role for librarians in improving literature search strategies and documentation.",

        "description":"The current study examines the impact of fieldwork activities on Indonesian preservice biology teachers' attitudes towards the environment and self-reported conservation behavior. A total of 283 Indonesian preservice biology teachers (16% male and 84% female) participated in the study and four different instruments were used to explore the research questions. Validity and reliability of the research instruments were tested by performing Rasch model analysis. To explore the moderation effect of fieldwork on correlated variables, multiple-regressions test was conducted. The findings showed that fieldwork acted as a moderating factor in creating the relationships between Ecocentric Concern and Personal Conservation Behavior and between Human Utilization attitude and Personal Conservation Behavior. The correlation between findings and the Indonesian preservice biology teachers' curriculum are discussed.",

          "Byrne, Jenny"],
        "description":"This study explores the current knowledge and understanding about animal biology of zoo visitors and investigates whether knowledge of animal biology influences the ability of people to understand how human activity affects biodiversity. Zoos can play a role in the development of scientific literacy in the fields of animal biology and biodiversity conservation via conservation education programmes by building on existing knowledge, as well as by challenging and correcting misconceptions. A survey of the knowledge and understanding of groups of zoo visitors about a variety of topics in animal biology was carried out. The study found that the knowledge and understanding of zoo visitors regarding basic animal biology is fairly secure but that their ideas about more complex concepts, such as ecological interdependence and physiological needs are unsophisticated and, at times, confused. Visitors found some topics to be particularly challenging, and some common misconceptions have been identified. However, in other topics they have shown their understanding to be greater than would perhaps be expected from the existing literature. The findings enabled a modified version of the Conservation Triangle proposed by Tunnicliffe [(1999). &quot;Zoos as centres of conservation education for primary school pupils.&quot; &quot;Proceedings of the 9th Symposium of the International Organization for Science and Technology (IOSTE),&quot; Vol. 2, 688-695. Durban, South Africa: University of Durban-Westville] to be developed that illustrates the knowledge and understanding deficit of zoo visitors via a hierarchy of biological concepts. Furthermore, findings suggest that zoo visitors are reasonably well informed about the effect that human activities can have on the natural world, although this is not necessarily their primary interest when they visit a zoo.",

        "description":"Genetic drift is a concept of population genetics that is central to understanding evolutionary processes and aspects of conservation biology. It is frequently taught using rather abstract representations. I introduce three real-life zoological examples, based on historical and recent color morphs of tigers, tapirs, and ravens, that can complement classical models.",
