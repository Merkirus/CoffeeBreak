        "author":["Letic, M."],
        "description":"The aim of this study was to explore the curricula of medical schools in Europe in order to establish a formal representation of physics in the study of medicine. Information on the curricular representation of physics was gathered from the Internet presentations of medical schools. It was intended to explore at least 25% of medical schools in each country. Curricula from 96 medical schools from 31 European countries were investigated. The formal representation of physics ranges from two courses with 195 h of instruction to absence from the curricula. The ratio of physics instruction in different medical schools is at least 1:6. These wide differences suggest the need to estimate the optimal range of physics instruction during studies of medicine. Since 26% of 96 medical schools do not mention obligatory physics courses in their curricula, it would be of interest to explore whether they have some form of physics instruction and the proportion of that instruction. The need to estimate the minimal physics instruction in such medical schools is implied. (Contains 4 figures.)",

        "description":"This study describes the duties and responsibilities of the medical physicist and estimates the number of medical physicists needed in the next decade. A questionnaire, sent to members of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, was designed to cover: characteristics of medical physicists, nature of work in medical physics, distribution of effort, publications, administration and supervision, training of medical physicists, budget for medical physics, and regional medical programs. Following a tabulation of questionnaire results, a discussion concerning duties and responsibilities, estimate of manpower needs, certification and accreditation, and emerging areas of specialization for medical physicists are included. Recommendations suggest: (1) At least one full-time  professional medical physicist is needed in each medical institution with more than 300 hospital beds. (2) Graduate training programs in medical physics shall terminate in a master or doctoral degree. In addition, experience shall be provided in clinical applications of pertinent subspecialities of physics. (3) Since projected needs would require doubling the number of medical physicists over the next 10 years, sufficient support of graduate training programs is essential. (4) Training programs in medical physics should be accredited. (5) Certification procedures for medical physicists need to be studied. (6) Courses on medical physics should be made available to premedical and medical students, as well as to paramedical students enrolled in schools of allied health sciences.  (MJM)",
