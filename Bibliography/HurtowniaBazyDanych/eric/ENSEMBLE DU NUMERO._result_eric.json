        "description":"An approach to elementary school French language instruction emphasizes sustained oral language through language analysis. The guide is intended for teachers of grades 3-6. It contains an introductory section, an explanation of the approach, a brief discussion of the linguistic content of oral language instruction, and four communicative classroom activities. The activities, based on formal situations, require both group and individual preparation and conclude with metalinguistic activities designed to systematically develop an explicit understanding of the linguistic content. Audiotaped playlets (not included) are intended to accompany each communicative activity; transcriptions of the playlets are appended to the guide. (MSE)",

Kaddoura, on nine major projects in science and technology for development; conference agenda; and recommendations related to seven themes (MAB activities in humid/sub-humid tropics, marginal lands, biosphere reserves, cities as ecological systems, use of scientific information for environmental education purposes, information needed for  decision-making on land management, and emerging issues and priority problems for the 1980's). The meeting of the International Coordinating Council, the intergovernmental body which directs and administers the MAB program, provided a forum for an evaluation and review of the first decade of its existence. This summary includes conference agenda, recommendations for improving the effectiveness of MAB in the future, highlights of Canadian presentations, and the personal perspectives of three Canadian delegates (Anne Whyte, George Francis, and Michel Maldague) on the conference.

        "description":"A pilot project was conducted from May 1980 to November 1983 to test the application of iNet--a decentralized, packet-switched telecommunications network--to bibliographic data interchange in Canada. The principal components of the project were participation of the Bibliographic Common Interest Group (BCIP), a group of libraries with stand-alone, operational, and stable online systems, in seven technical subprojects involving the development and testing of value added network interfaces, online iNet directories, bibliographic data derivation, online interlibrary loan facilities, videotex services, file transfer facilities, and access to online database vendors and other information providers; development of computer/communications protocols for bibliographic data interchange; the  addressing of network policy issues; the videography subproject which studied the feasibility of utilizing videodisc and computer/communications technology to further library service objectives; the development of network contract guidelines; and the study of Canadian interlibrary loan and document delivery policies and practices. It was found that it is possible to connect diverse stand-alone and incompatible systems through standard interfaces to a packet-switched data communications network and that iNet was a useful prototype of an open network. This publication (in English and French) describes project methodology and results and presents nine recommendations based on project findings. (ESR)",

This content is not included in the functionally oriented official curriculum. The linguistic content proposed consists of a number of formal variants corresponding to non-formal stylistic markers and respecting certain explicit criteria. The content, designed to develop the children's use of the formal variants in appropriate situations, has been tried in a regular fourth grade class. The children were recorded in a series of increasingly formal communicative situations and participated in metalinguistic classroom activities about parts of the content. Results show that (1) children spontaneously change their ways of speaking according to the  formality of situations and are aware of the change in their speech, but are not aware of the linguistic formal and informal variants involved; and (2) during metalinguistic activities, the children developed an explicit awareness of many of those variants, increasing their use of formal variants afterwards.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of wind ensemble seating configurations on college instrumentalists' ratings of ensemble sound. Members of a university wind ensemble (N = 40) were recorded while performing a 1-minute excerpt of &quot;Only Light&quot; by Aaron Perrine in one of four ensemble configurations. At the conclusion of the recording session, the performers wrote free-response comments to &quot;In which of the four configurations did you feel the ensemble sounded their best?&quot; and &quot;Why?&quot; Another set of participants, college ensemble members (N = 121), listened to the four audio recordings and rated the ensemble tone quality, ensemble balance, and ensemble blend of each performance. Performers mentioned that ensemble balance and ensemble blend were important factors that influenced their decision as to why the ensemble sounded their best in a particular configuration. An analysis of the composite ratings revealed a significant main effect for ensemble configuration. However, there was a significant ensemble configuration × order interaction signifying that participants' ratings were influenced by the order in which they heard the excerpts. Our results may suggest that ensemble configurations produce different listening environments for performers and audience members.",

        "author":["Silvey, Brian A."],
        "description":"This study was designed to examine whether the presence of excellent or poor ensemble performances would influence the ratings assigned by ensemble members to conductors who demonstrated highly expressive conducting. Two conductors were videotaped conducting one of two excerpts from an arrangement of Frank Ticheli's \"Loch Lomond.\" These videos subsequently were duplicated and synchronized with either excellent or poor performances that previously had been recorded with a university wind ensemble. To determine whether identical conducting performances would be evaluated differently on the basis of excellent or poor ensemble performance, college band, choir, and orchestra members (N = 120) viewed each of the four 1-minute excerpts and rated conductor expressivity and ensemble performance quality on 10-point Likert-type scales and provided one brief written comment about each video. Results indicated that ensemble performance quality significantly affected ratings of conductor expressivity (p less than 0.001). However, the effect size was modest (partial eta[superscript 2] = 0.29). Participants' written comments were directed most frequently to the conductor in the excellent-performance condition and to the ensemble in the poor-performance condition.

        "description":"The Happy Roll Elastic Ensemble (HREE) is a community music ensemble supported by Tainan Culture Centre in Taiwan. With enjoyment and friendship as its primary goals, it aims to facilitate the joys of ensemble playing and the spirit of social networking. This article highlights the key aspects of HREE's development in its first two years (2009-2011), including musical and administrative decisions and operations. In addition, several problems within the HREE are described along with their solutions as well as the implications for the future of this ensemble. Through carefully planned directing and tailored arrangement of music, the HREE confirmed that community music activities could provide opportunities to construct personal and communal expressions of artistic and social concerns. Feedback from its members indicated their enjoyment and progress in developing musical literacy. The HREE is an example that demonstrates how a joyful community music ensemble could serve as the seed that grows and brings the residents towards a richer and better life together.",
