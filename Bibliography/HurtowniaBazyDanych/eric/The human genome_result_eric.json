        "description":"Genome science, including topics such as gene recombination, cloning, genetic tests, and gene therapy, is now an established part of our daily lives; thus we need to learn genome science to better equip ourselves for the present day. Learning from topics directly related to the human has been suggested to be more effective than learning from Mendel's peas not only because many students do not understand that plants are organisms, but also because human biology contains important social and health issues. Therefore, we have developed a teaching program for the introduction to genome science, whose subjects are focused on the human genome. This program comprises mixed multimedia presentations: a large poster with illustrations and text on the human genome (a human genome map for every home), and animations on the basics of genome science. We implemented and assessed this program at four high schools. Our results indicate that students felt that they learned about the human genome from the program and some increases in students' understanding were observed with longer exposure to the mixed multimedia presentations.

        "description":"The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) led the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) contribution to the International Human Genome Project, whose primary goal was the sequencing of the human genome. This project was successfully completed in April 2003. Now, the NHGRI's mission is focused on a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health, disease, and society. This document describes the NHGRI Health Disparities Strategic Plan, which reflects the overall goals of the NIH. NHGRI's specific research goals in this area are to: (1) advance our understanding of the development and progression of diseases that contribute to health disparities; (2) develop a detailed understanding of the heritable variation in the human genome; (3) develop robust strategies for identifying the genetic contributions to disease and drug response; (4) use newly acquired knowledge regarding genes and pathways as a basis for the development of new, targeted therapeutic approaches to diseases that contribute to health disparities; (5) investigate how genetic risk information is conveyed in clinical settings and how that information influences health strategies and behaviors; (6) advance our understanding of the relationships between genomics, race, and ethnicity, and the consequences of uncovering these relationships; (7) develop new or improved approaches for detecting and diagnosing the onset of diseases that contribute to health disparities; and (8) advance our understanding of the ethical, legal, and social implications of genome research and its role in understanding the causes of health disparities. This document presents the performance measures, outcome measures, and action plans for each of these eight research goals.",

Accompanying interviews with the staff illustrate different entry levels for a career in genome science. This video project serves as an example of how research and academic institutions can provide teachers and students with access and exposure to innovative technologies at the forefront of biomedical research.

        "description":"Although epidemiological data provide evidence that early life experience plays a critical role in human development, the mechanism of how this works remains in question. Recent data from human and animal literature suggest that epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, are involved not only in cellular differentiation but also in the modulation of genome function in response to early life experience affecting gene function and the phenotype. Such modulations may serve as a mechanism for life-long genome adaptation. These changes seem to be widely distributed across the genome and to involve central and peripheral systems. Examining the environmental circumstances associated with the onset and reversal of DNA methylation will be critical for understanding risk and resiliency. (Contains 4 figures.)",

Over the past few years, structural variation has been shown to be far more common in human genomes than previously thought. Very little is currently known about the effects of structural variation on normal child development, but such effects could be of considerable significance. This review provides an overview of the phenomenon of structural variation in the human genome sequence, describing the novel genomics technologies that are revolutionizing the way structural variation is studied and giving examples of genomic structural variations that affect child development.

        "description":"The debate about the relevance of human genetics knowledge to everyday life has been marked by fluctuations of interest and enthusiasm. The negative impact of eugenics on the public consciousness suppressed dialogue between geneticists and the public for most of the second half of the 20th century (Ridley, 1999). For the most part, nongeneticists did not follow the development of the science of genetics closely, even with regard to the discovery of the genetic code, during this period. Research on genetics was often not considered relevant for public health because genetic disorders were thought to be rare (Thomas, 2004). All of this changed, however, with the sequencing of the full genome by the Human Genome Project in 2003 (Human Genome Program, 2008). The Human Genome Project triggered discussion in numerous spheres, including medicine (e.g., Weinshilboum, 2002), law (e.g., Torrance, 2010), and biotechnology (e.g., Herring, 2007). However, relatively little of this discussion has penetrated the field of developmental science, with some notable exceptions (e.g., Plomin, DeFries, Craig, &amp; McGuffin, 2003; Plomin &amp; Rutter, 1998), including Plomin's contribution to this Special Section. Developmental science is just beginning to address the implications of the genomic revolution. This Special Section of &quot;Child Development&quot; was designed to stimulate this discussion.",
