        "description":"This article presents a review of literature exploring five different perspectives on mathematical modeling in mathematics education. Because there is not a single agreed-on definition of what mathematical modeling is or how it should be done, a focused and extensive review of mathematical modeling is essential. The five broad classifications discussed in this article include realistic modeling, educational modeling, models and modeling perspective, socio-critical modeling, and epistemological modeling. For each perspective, we present (a) the goals of mathematical modeling, (b) the definition of a mathematical model, (c) the mathematical modeling cycle, (d) the design of the modeling task, and (e) key researchers and research foci. In this article, we aim to present the different perspectives of mathematical modeling in an organized way so as to (1) demonstrate the rich and diverse background of mathematical modeling and (2) clarify theoretical foundations of seminal works in mathematical modeling.",

Design/Approach/Methods: In this context, the present study is a qualitative research based on document analysis. The data were analyzed using semantic content analysis, and the selected modeling tasks based on different mathematical modeling perspectives were examined at the sentence level. Findings: Control, mystery, and openness mathematical values appeared in all mathematical modeling tasks, and rationalism and objectivism mathematical values appeared in realistic/applied and socio-critical modeling perspectives. Product, exploration, creating, relevance, pleasure, and application mathematics educational values also emerged in all modeling tasks. Educational values of social justice, equity, social welfare, humanity, and altruism were more important in the socio-critical modeling, while the value of individualism was more emphasized in the model-eliciting approach. Originality/Value: By determining mathematical, mathematics educational, and educational values involved in mathematical modeling tasks based on different mathematical modeling perspectives, an effective and more value-balanced mathematical modeling instruction can be provided.",

        "description":"Views of mathematical modeling in empirical, expository, and curricular references typically capture a relationship between real-world phenomena and mathematical ideas from the perspective that competence in mathematical modeling is a clear goal of the mathematics curriculum. However, we work within a curricular context in which mathematical modeling is treated more as a venue for learning other mathematics than as an instructional goal in its own right. From this perspective, we are compelled to ask \"how learning of mathematics beyond modeling may occur\" as students generate and validate mathematical models. We consider a diagrammatic model of mathematical modeling as a process that allows us to identify how mathematical understandings may develop or surface while learners engage in modeling tasks. Through examples from prospective teachers' mathematical modeling work, we illustrate how our diagrammatic model serves as a tool to unpack the intricacies of students' mathematical experience while engaging in modeling tasks.",

This paper compares pre-service mathematics teachers' professional mathematical modeling competencies in three different regions--Germany, Mainland China, and Hong Kong--where educational and cultural traditions differ, including the role of mathematical modeling. In total, 232 pre-service mathematics teachers from the three regions completed a modeling task covering mathematics content knowledge (MCK) of modeling and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge (MPCK) of modeling. The results show that pre-service teachers from Germany demonstrated the strongest MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling; by contrast, pre-service mathematics teachers from Mainland China and Hong Kong demonstrated relatively weaker MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling. MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling were also found to be unevenly developed at different competence levels for the three regions. These differences may be attributed to the history of mathematical modeling in mathematics curricula, teacher education, and teaching culture in these three regions.",

        "description":"Engaging with mathematical modeling can support learners to collaboratively explore mathematics in integrated ways as well as generate mathematical ideas and representations that may be useful in everyday life. Although several studies provide diverse insights into teaching and learning mathematical modeling, research has yet to be conducted on the mathematical modeling learning opportunities available to secondary mathematics preservice teachers (PTs) in mathematics and education courses in teacher education programs. This study investigates the mathematical modeling learning opportunities reported by 48 instructors and ten focus groups of 37 PTs. Multiple data sources (e.g., interview transcripts, syllabi, tasks, and exams) collected from universities were used to achieve triangulation in this case study of secondary preparation programs. When asked about mathematical modeling, both PTs and instructors reported rich examples of mathematical modeling from the opportunities afforded by their respective programs. Both also reported modeling experiences that were not mathematical modeling, such as word problems, representations, or demonstrations. Along with the study's particular themes and examples, common mathematical modeling opportunities recalled by PTs and instructors are elaborated in our findings. This study intends to begin a discussion of possible pathways for providing rich opportunities for PTs to engage in mathematical modeling.",

However, researchers have shown that mathematical modeling activities can be difficult for teachers to implement. Teachers are more likely to implement mathematical modeling activities if they have their own successful experiences with such activities. This paper describes one well-structured framework for implementing mathematical modeling with the Common Core State mathematics standards that incorporates the Standards for Mathematical Practice. One class of preservice secondary teachers engaged in a mathematical modeling activity, reflected on their experience, and discussed how they could implement similar modeling activities. This study describes the preservice secondary teachers' work on the modeling activity, their impressions of the activity, and how the mathematical modeling activity was effectively structured in connection to the Common Core State Standards.",

A total of 57 preservice mathematics teachers voluntarily participated in the study, which lasted for a period of five weeks. Data sources included three separate measurements; Mathematical Modeling Test, a questionnaire about the meaning of mathematical modeling, and model-eliciting activities. A quantitative and qualitative data analysis approach was employed in order to better understand the intervention achievement. The Mathematical Modeling Test data was examined with paired sample t-test, and the other two datasets were examined using thematic analysis to identify the preservice teachers' pedagogical content knowledge through mathematical modeling and their performance at each step of the mathematical modeling. Data analysis revealed that although the preservice teachers increased their mathematical modeling knowledge, they experienced difficulties during the interpretation and adaptation of the mathematical modeling results into the real life situations.",

The study investigated 208 PK-8 preservice teachers' (PSTs') familiarity and experiences with mathematical modeling. The study adopted a survey-design perspective to collect data from 10 universities in a mid-western state in the United States of America (U.S.). Data collected were analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results from the study indicated that PSTs were familiar with some outcomes related to mathematical modeling practices. However, their familiarity and experiences seem limited, and their perception of mathematical modeling practices were traditional in nature. Most of the PSTs had misconceived definitions regarding mathematical modeling and confused mathematical modeling with model mathematics. Furthermore, most PSTs reported they had no formal exposure or training in practices associated with mathematical modeling during their teacher preparation program. The findings suggest that infusing modeling courses or modules in existing methods or content courses in teacher education programs can be an effective way to elevate PSTs from unfamiliarity of mathematical modeling practices and standards These results along with a supplemental discussion have implications for teacher preparation programs and researchers centered on mathematical modeling education.",

        "description":"In recent years, Mainland Chinese teams have been the dominant participants in the two COMAP-sponsored mathematical modeling competitions: the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) and the Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). This study examines five factors that lead to the Chinese teams' dramatic increase in participation rate and performance in the MCM and ICM: the Chinese government's support, pertinent organizations' efforts, support from initiators of Chinese mathematical modeling education and local resources, Chinese teams' preferences in selecting competition problems to solve, and influence from the Chinese National College Entrance Examination (NCEE). The data made clear that (1) the policy support provided by the Chinese government laid a solid foundation in popularizing mathematical modeling activities in China, especially in initial stages of the development of mathematical modeling activities. (2) Relevant organizations have been the main driving force behind the development of mathematical modeling activities in China. (3) Initiators of mathematical modeling education were the masterminds of Chinese mathematical modeling development; support from other local resources served as the foundation of mathematical modeling popularity in China. (4) Chinese teams have revealed a preference for discrete over continuous mathematical problems in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling. However, in general, the winning rates of these two problem types have been shown to be inversely related to their popularity--while discrete problems have traditionally had higher attempt rates, continuous problems enjoyed higher winning rates. (5) The NCEE mathematics examination seems to include mathematical application problems rather than actual mathematical modeling problems. Although the extent of NCEE influence on students' mathematical modeling ability is unclear, the content coverage suggests that students completing a high school mathematics curriculum should be able to apply what they learned to simplified real-world situations, and pose solutions to the simple models built in these situations. This focus laid a solid mathematics foundation for students' future study and application of mathematics. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

        "description":"Mathematical modeling has been positioned at the forefront of many educational levels globally because modeling reinforces purposeful problem-solving skills, connects mathematics to the real-world, and makes mathematics more meaningful and relevant. This article investigated K-12 practicing teachers' knowledge and attitudes toward mathematical modeling, while considering the relationships between them and some selected demographic variables. The study involved 335 teachers from Midwestern United States of America (U.S.), and data was collected through an Online self-administered survey. The data collected were quantitatively analyzed with the guidance of the research questions, and using statistical analyses such as correlation, multiple regression, and ANOVA. Results showed that teachers had a satisfactory knowledge and attitudes toward mathematical modeling. Teachers' knowledge of modeling was found to be positively related to their overall attitudes toward such modeling, with an R[superscript 2] = 0.25 suggesting a moderate relationship. Overall, gender and grade level band were identified as strong indicators of teachers' knowledge and attitudes toward mathematical modeling. In particular, female teachers on average showed a relatively stronger knowledge and attitudes toward mathematical modeling than their male colleagues. Similarly, elementary teachers demonstrated a relatively stronger knowledge of mathematical modeling and attitudes toward such modeling than middle or high school teachers. Findings from this study have implications for integrating mathematical modeling standards into teacher preparation programs and organizing professional development on mathematical modeling education.",

        "description":"Mathematical modeling is a critical component of the current K-12 mathematics, science, and technology and engineering (T&amp;E) educational standards in the United States. However, mathematical modeling is often overlooked or underemphasized in integrative STEM lessons. This could be attributed to teachers' limited content and pedagogical knowledge related to integrating mathematical modeling in integrative STEM lessons. Continual advances in technologies like 3D design and printing software and additive manufacturing processes now allow students to see abstract mathematical modeling concepts in contextualized and practical forms. Consequently, we examined changes in mathematics, science, and T&amp;E teachers' mathematical modeling knowledge and views resulting from a 1-day integrative professional development (PD) experience. The PD specifically focused on applying mathematical modeling concepts to design and 3D print solutions to integrative STEM lessons. A sample of 50 participating teachers reported increases in certain mathematical modeling knowledge areas, and a large percentage indicated they were more likely to implement mathematical modeling in their classrooms. The results from this study indicated that integrative PD could enhance teachers' content knowledge, practices, and views about integrative STEM lessons including mathematical modeling and 3D printing. The findings from this study have implications for teachers, school districts, researchers, and professional development providers.",

        "author":["Gould, Heather"],
        "description":"The release of the &quot;Common Core State Standards for Mathematics&quot; in 2010 resulted in a new focus on mathematical modeling in United States curricula. Mathematical modeling represents a way of doing and understanding mathematics new to most teachers. The purpose of this study was to determine the conceptions and misconceptions held by teachers about mathematical models and modeling in order to aid in the development of teacher education and professional development programs. The study used a mixed methods approach. Quantitative data were collected through an online survey of a large sample of practicing and prospective secondary teachers of mathematics in the United States. The purpose of this was to gain an understanding of the conceptions held by the general population of United States secondary mathematics teachers. In particular, basic concepts of mathematical models, mathematical modeling, and mathematical modeling in education were analyzed. Qualitative data were obtained from case studies of a small group of mathematics teachers who had enrolled in professional development which had mathematical models or modeling as a focus. The purpose of these case studies was to give an illustrative view of teachers regarding modeling, as well as to gain some understanding of how participating in professional development affects teachers&apos; conceptions. The data showed that US secondary mathematics teachers hold several misconceptions about models and modeling, particularly regarding aspects of the mathematical modeling process. Specifically, the majority of teachers do not understand that the mathematical modeling process always requires making choices and assumptions, and that mathematical modeling situations must come from real-world scenarios. A large minority of teachers have misconceptions about various other characteristics of mathematical models and the mathematical modeling process.

        "description":"Incorporating modeling activities into classroom instruction requires flexibility with pedagogical content knowledge and the ability to understand and interpret students' thinking, skills that teachers often develop through experience. One way to support preservice mathematics teachers' (PSMTs) proficiency with mathematical modeling is by incorporating modeling tasks into mathematics pedagogy courses, allowing PSMTs to engage with mathematical modeling as &quot;students&quot; and as future &quot;teachers.&quot; Eight PSMTs participated in a model-eliciting activity (MEA) in which they were asked to develop a model that describes the strength of the magnetic field generated by a solenoid. By engaging in mathematical modeling as &quot;students,&quot; these PSMTs became aware of their own proficiency with and understanding of mathematical modeling. By engaging in mathematical modeling as future &quot;teachers,&quot; these PSMTs were able to articulate the importance of incorporating MEAs into their own instruction.",

Unlike other studies that have focused on single-topic and lesson-sized research sites, a course-sized research site was used in this study. Having been through several iterations over three teaching semesters, the 15-week long course was implemented with 25 pre-service secondary mathematics teachers. Findings revealed that pre-service teachers developed ideas about the nature of mathematical modeling involving what mathematical modeling is, the relationship between mathematical modeling and meaningful understanding, and the nature of mathematical modeling tasks. They also realized the changing roles of teachers during modeling implementations and diversity in students' ways of thinking. The researchers' conceptual development, on the other hand, involved realizing the critical aspect of the &quot;teacher role&quot; played by the instructor during modeling implementations, and the need for more experience of modeling implementations for pre-service teachers.",
