        "description":"Teaching biochemistry well is not an easy job for teachers and so is learning biochemistry well for students. Just as many students often complain, they virtually always fail in either physiology or biochemistry. I have been teaching biochemistry at Nanjing University for over 25 years and am very successful in my biochemistry-teaching career. The way and style that I teach biochemistry is highly praised by both my students and my fellow teachers. As an instructor, the most important thing is, I think, you have to do your best to arouse or ignite students' interest in biochemistry learning. But how? In this article, I will introduce many first-hand practical tips on how to arouse the students 'interest in studying biochemistry from giving the first lecture to last lecture, from how to combine advanced teaching methods with traditional teaching methods to how to combine classic biochemistry with latest biochemical developments, from the main classroom teaching to organization of extracurricular activities as the second classroom, and so on. These tips are proven very useful and then can be followed by other professors who are teaching biochemistry. Hopefully, they can help many professors improve their skills for teaching biochemistry.",

        "description":"Biochemistry, a complicated basic course in health sciences, plays a fundamental role in describing pathogenic mechanism of illness in molecular terms, and is required to be learned for all medical students. Due to various obstacles to biochemistry learning and teaching, there is a pressing issue of curriculum reform to arouse the student's enthusiasm in biochemistry learning. In this study, an integrated topic-based biochemistry training program (TBBTP) combining the traditional lectures, question-based learning and experimental practices, was introduced in biochemistry teaching. Its effectiveness was evaluated through examination and questionnaire analyses. Consequently, we found that TBBTP promoted the dissemination of biochemical knowledge via traditional lecture, designated learning issues and experimental practices, and acquisition of various skills through practical operation, presentation, and independent learning. It motivated students to study biochemistry with intense interest and enthusiasm. This study explored the feasibility of the topic-based biochemistry teaching as a supplement to biochemistry curriculum in medical education and as a mainstream pedagogy in biochemistry lab.",

Studies have been conducted that describe students' abilities to use and interpret specific types of ERs. However, a framework for describing ERs derived through a naturalistic inquiry of biochemistry classrooms has not been proposed in the literature. The Taxonomy of Biochemistry External Representations (TOBER) is proposed as a method for classifying the types of ERs used in biochemistry classrooms. Johnstone's domains of chemical knowledge is extended to the discipline of biochemistry to form the \"Biochemistry Tetrahedron\" and the TOBER is mapped on to it. Ainsworth's Functional Taxonomy of Multiple ERs is connected to biochemistry and is used in conjunction with the TOBER and Biochemistry Tetrahedron to derive implications for research and classroom practice.

        "description":"Biochemistry encompasses a broad range of life science disciplines. Unlike more vocational disciplines such as pharmacy or medicine, the career path associated with biochemistry is less clearly defined. An important question is whether the skills set provided by post-graduate biochemistry education, defined as BSc (Hons.), MSc, or PhD degrees, is aligned with the requirements of a career in academia or industry. This article reports on former post-graduate biochemistry students and their careers and aims to establish whether former post-graduate students perceive a post-graduate qualification in biochemistry as useful for entry into the job market. This article is based on responses of 64 former post-graduate biochemistry students from South African universities who have graduated between 2010 and 2019. Findings show that most post-graduate biochemistry graduates continue a career in academia after graduating. Some pursue a career in the industry, while a very small number of biochemistry post-graduates are currently unemployed. These findings suggest that a post-graduate degree in biochemistry provides the necessary scientific and research skills sought after by the employment sector in South Africa.",

One component of this course required the biochemistry majors to act as educational assistants, leading problem-based learning sessions in a cooperative learning introductory survey biochemistry course for nonmajors. Problem-based learning scenarios used in this course were based on real-life biochemistry problems. As a result of their participation, the educational assistants increased their understanding of the biochemistry principles, gained an appreciation for the difficulty of the job of a &quot;good teacher,&quot; developed new approaches to their own learning, and became more confident speakers. The participating biochemistry faculty were also positively affected by the collaborative approach they were attempting to model for the two sets of students and realized the benefits of truly cooperative team teaching.",

They are frequently studied prior to medical school and are fundamental to the teaching of biomedical sciences in undergraduate medical education.

We conducted a survey to explore the evolving trends in biochemistry education. A broad diversity was evident in parameters including course content, faculty, governance, prerequisites, and teaching methods. Notably, sharp differences were apparent between freestanding biochemistry courses and those in which biochemistry is integrated with other subjects. Furthermore, the data imply a likely trend toward increased integration of biochemistry with other disciplines in the medical school curriculum. (Contains 1 box and 4 figures.)",

        "description":"A strong, recent movement in tertiary education is the development of conceptual, or &quot;big idea&quot; teaching. The emphasis in course design is now on promoting key understandings, core competencies, and an understanding of connections between different fields. In biochemistry teaching, this radical shift from the content-based tradition is being driven by the &quot;omics&quot; information explosion; we can no longer teach all the information we have available. Biochemistry is a core, enabling discipline for much of modern scientific research, and biochemistry teaching is in urgent need of a method for delivery of conceptual frameworks. In this project, we aimed to define the key concepts in biochemistry. We find that the key concepts we defined map well onto the core science concepts recommended by the Vision and Change project. We developed a new method to present biochemistry through the lenses of these concepts. This new method challenged the way we thought about biochemistry as teachers. It also stimulated the majority of the students to think more deeply about biochemistry and to make links between biochemistry and material in other courses. This method is applicable to the full spectrum of content usually taught in biochemistry. (Contains 4 figures and 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Vertical integration has been extensively implemented across medical school curricula but has not been widely attempted in the field of biochemistry. We describe a novel curricular innovation in which a near-peer learning model was used to implement vertical integration in our medical school biochemistry course. Senior medical students developed and facilitated a case-based small group session for first year biochemistry students. Students were surveyed before and after the session on their attitudes about biochemistry, as well as the effectiveness of the session. Prior to the session, the students believed biochemistry was more important to understanding the basic science of medicine than it was to understanding clinical medicine or becoming a good physician. The session improved students' attitudes about the importance of biochemistry in clinical medicine, and after the session they now believe that understanding biochemistry is equally important to the basic sciences as clinical medicine. Students would like more sessions and believe the senior student facilitators were knowledgeable and effective teachers. The facilitators believe they improved their teaching skills. This novel combination of near-peer learning and vertical integration in biochemistry provided great benefit to both first year and senior medical students, and can serve as a model for other institutions.",
