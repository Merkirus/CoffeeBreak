        "description":"This set of two audio cassette tapes was recorded at the 1969 AAAS meeting on Ecology and the undergraduate curriculum. Four papers were presented each followed by a question and answer session. Dr. Darnell presented a paper titled \"The New Ecology.\" The paper outlined the historical roots of ecology and defined the new perspectives of ecology, namely, systems ecology. The second speaker, Dr. Bovbjerg, presented a paper titled \"Ecology as a Primary Discipline of the Biological Sciences.\" The speaker addressed himself to two main issues (1) Does ecology have a unique position in biology and could omitting it be a deprivation in the training of young biologists? (2) How pervasive is ecology? Dr. Kormandy's paper, presented by Dr. Darnell, was titled \"Ecology and the Environment.\"  The paper defended the position that a new environmental ethic must prevail before an environmental change is to take place. Dr. Cox presented a paper titled \"Laboratory Approaches to Teaching Ecology.\" The paper suggested how new and existing ecology courses can be improved. The paper outlined an ecology course being taught at the organism, population and ecosystem levels using an inductive or experimental approach. Trends in teaching ecology were identified and the speaker closed by outlining a series of courses in a new undergraduate program in his university. (BB)",

These are personal ecology, professional ecology, organizational ecology, and community ecology. Using today's superintendency as an administrative platform, current literature describes a preponderance of stress in school leadership. An exhaustive analysis of recent literature reveals a lack of introspective vision needed to fully understand the dynamics between administrative shortages and specific characteristics surrounding the superintendency. Defining the interconnections between school leaders and their respective organizational environment is a vital first step.",

        "description":"In particular, it is of great importance that teacher candidates are trained to develop awareness of ecology and to protect ecological systems. Because they are the ones who will be educate future generations. Ecology is generally a conceptual field. In this study, it was aimed to determine the conceptual structures related to ecology of science teacher candidates at cognitive level. The study is a qualitative research carried out by the screening model. The study was carried out with the participation of 127 candidates' science teachers. In this study, a word association test (WAT) was used to determine the cognitive structures of science teacher candidates related to &quot;ecology&quot;. Content analysis and descriptive analysis methods were used in the analysis of data. In this data, the frequency table has been formed. Based on the frequency tables prepared according to teacher candidates' responses to WAT, concept networks related to ecology have been established. In the preparation of concept networks, cut point technique was used. When we look at the frequency table, it was observed that the key words that teacher candidates associate most with ecology are living places, functional properties of ecology and biotic factors of ecosystems in ecology. The sentences of teacher candidates related to ecology are selected and categorized according to the concepts they contain. When the sentences of teacher candidates related to ecology are examined, it is seen that correct descriptions are found but in many of them there is incomplete information or concept confusion.",

        "description":"This paper addresses student-teachers' ability to &quot;read nature&quot; in a woodland habitat before and after a 10-week ecology course. &quot;Reading nature&quot; is our definition of the ability to observe, describe and explain basic ecology in the field. Data consists of field-based pre-course and post-course interviews followed up by metacognitive interviews where students analyse their own learning. A bi-dimensional coding scheme is adopted to examine the range and development of students' ability to &quot;read nature.&quot; Students find it important to know the ecology of a few key species and they recognize the importance of having learned the language of ecology -- &quot;ecologish&quot; -- helping them to describe and discuss ecology. Students generally recognize the excursions as key learning situations in ecology education but they give different reasons for finding excursions so important. This variation will be elaborated in the paper together with the implications for teaching ecology.",

A complete box may be considered an in-depth course of study, and the instructions for users are based on this approach. The three-week experimental course is designed for students in grades 7 to 13 and requires devoting their entire time to the course for this period. Students are expected to master the general principles of ecology and study one ecology idea in depth. Suggestions for the ecology course include: step-by-step  instructions for building the ecology continuum for Week 1; ten ecology ideas (entropy, ocean, growth, energy, dirt, rock, forest, diversity, environment, cycles) for Week 2; and an ecology exhibition for Week 3 based on the individual student study of ecology ideas. Materials contained in the EcoBoxes are noted in the final section. These include books, magazines, records, films, posters, prints, charts, maps, tapes, games, and multi-media kits.

These new procedures extend grounded theory, providing bridges in moving from study phenomenon to design and from analysis to interpretation. Procedures for analyzing the data must be clearly understood before beginning grounded theory methodology. Strategies must be outlined, approaches to the ecology discussed, and awareness of the ecology attained. Following these procedures can lead to a rewarding qualitative research experience and produce new knowledge for understanding the human  ecology. (Author)",
