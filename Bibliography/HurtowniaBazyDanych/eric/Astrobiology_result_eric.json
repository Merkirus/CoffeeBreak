        "description":"Astrobiology is, on a profound level, about whether life exists outside of the planet Earth. The question of existence of life elsewhere in the universe has been of interest to many societies throughout history. Recently, the research area of astrobiology has grown at a fast rate, mainly due to the development of observational methods, and the media is frequently reporting on new research findings. International surveys show that astrobiology questions are among those that interest young people the most. The popularity of astrobiology and the way it captures much science content makes it an interesting area for science teaching. However, there is very little research directly focused upon students' views in astrobiology. The study reported in this paper draws from the answers of 186 Swedish lower secondary students (16 years old) to a questionnaire, with closed and open-ended questions regarding their views of issues in astrobiology. The study was guided by the worldview theory (Cobern 1991; Cobern, &quot;Science Education&quot; 80(5):579-610, 1996; Cobern, &quot;Science and Education&quot; 9:219-246, 2000). The results show that even though basic reasoning in astrobiology is known by a majority of the students, there is a considerable number of students, for whom this is not the case. Furthermore, it was found that for all questions, there are students answering in different ways when asked to describe their own view and the view they associate with science researchers. The implications of the study for further research and for the teaching of astrobiology in science class are discussed.",

        "description":"The field of astrobiology is concerned with the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the Universe. It contains within it civilization-level questions such as: What is the future of humanity on Earth and can we successfully explore and settle other planets? As such, it offers an educational framework for both teaching basic science and for engaging individuals in questions about how society can take on its biggest challenges and opportunities. Life Beyond is a collaboration between the UK Centre for Astrobiology and the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to take astrobiology into the prison environment. Using a pilot program across four Scottish prisons, a 4-week astrobiology course focused on designing a station for Mars was developed. Learning outcomes ranged from improvements in literacy, numeracy, and science skills to enhancing civic responsibilities. The results of the initiative are products such as Mars station designs, essays, and art, providing participants with tangible outputs. We describe the pilot initiative, the 4-week Life Beyond course, and draw conclusions about the use of astrobiology as a vehicle for teaching science and advancing social reform in the prison environment.",

        "title":"Using Astrobiology as a Platform to Study the Impact on the Mathematical Content Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge of Elementary Education Majors",
        "author":["Berthelson, Meredith Kay"],
        "description":"Early mathematical skills have long been hailed as a cornerstone and as the best predictor of later success in mathematics and literacy. This perception highlights the importance of elementary educator's mathematical content knowledge (MCK) and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). This study explored a novel approach to motivating and facilitating preservice elementary educators' engagement in an interdisciplinary context. Astrobiology is a growing interdisciplinary field with extraordinary educational potential. It has the potential to provide an exciting science framework structure to mathematics for preservice educators. Due to its interdisciplinary content, astrobiology offers preservice educators an opportunity to see math content through a science lens, an approach that may appeal to students with diverse interests. Although astrobiology research has been on the rise and has contributed greatly to the science field and to society, more research on astrobiology education in schools and colleges needs to be done to understand the best pedagogical approaches to such a diverse topic that encompasses multiple disciplines. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study examines whether the implementation of astrobiology modules focused on science questions could be used as an effective platform to deliver mathematical instruction that focuses on MCK and PCK. Specifically, this dissertation investigates the impact of such modules on preservice elementary educators' MCK and PCK, both quantitatively and qualitatively. A comprehensive analysis involving nonparametric statistics and qualitative analysis found insufficient sample evidence at the alpha level of 0.05 (alpha=0.05) to warrant rejection that the astrobiology based mathematical modules had no effect on the preservice teachers' MCK or PCK. However, one test found a positive correlation between the module and an increase in astrobiology knowledge. The qualitative examination exposed a decrease in the quality of responses for the MCK and PCK areas. This affect could be attributed to the limiting factors of the study. These factors have implications for both teaching future research in the intersection of astrobiology education and MCK and PCK.

        "description":"Humans have long pondered the question of life's origins on Earth and sought to understand their place in the vast expanse of the Universe. Are they alone, in which case the inception of life is a phenomenon unique to planet Earth, or will they find signs of life on other terrestrial bodies? Today, technology allows space probes and rovers to arrive at their destinations, bringing distant worlds such as Mars and Saturn's moon, Titan, to people's doorstep with exciting news about the search for life beyond Earth. At the core of these developments is NASA's Astrobiology program, a rapidly expanding field of scientific research committed to exploring the origin of life on Earth and the potential for life to exist elsewhere in the Universe (NASA, 2001). The purpose of this article is to provide educators current information, resources, and an effective model for teaching astrobiology to students. The NASA Astrobiology research objectives were the primary source of inspiration for creating the curriculum: (1) To discover the process by which life begins and evolves; (2) To search for the existence of life elsewhere in the universe; and (3) To try to understand what lies in the future for life on Earth and beyond (NASA, 2001). As space probes continue to explore the surface of Mars and the atmospheres of Titan and Europa, it is hoped that teachers will use this curricular framework to inspire a future generation of scientists and informed citizens to support the scientific enterprise and the quest for life beyond the planet Earth.

        "description":"Encouraging students' interest in science has never been more important. Science plays a greater role in everyones lives than ever before, and students who have a solid foundation in science are prepared to pursue a wide range of opportunities in high school, college, and the workplace. Yet many students--particularly girls and students from diverse cultural backgrounds--are leaving school without the confidence or preparation they need in science. Research shows that boys and girls start out their education with equal interest and aptitude in science. However, by about sixth grade, more girls than boys begin to turn away from science--even though they still have the aptitude for the subject. The reasons for this are subtle and rooted in cultural stereotypes. These stereotypes are changing, but still influence how students view science and their relationship to it. This article discusses Sally Ride Science, a company dedicated to empowering girls to explore the world of science--from astrobiology to zoology.",

        "description":"Although the use of portfolios to assess student performance in K-12 science classrooms and to monitor the training of preservice science teachers is increasingly common, their implementation in undergraduate science courses is still limited. The work presented here represents one in-depth example of the integration of portfolio assessment into the standard assessment practices of a general education course for nonscience majors. The subject matter of the course was astrobiology, but the approach would work equally well for other science disciplines. The portfolio assignments were characterized by intensive writing, iteration on written assignments, engaging with popular and semitechnical articles on the subject matter, and expressing scientific principles involved in other contexts. The work described here will be of interest to other science instructors curious about ways in which to design portfolio assessments for use with nonscience majors to support general education requirements.

        "description":"Following the growth of online, higher-education courses, academic institutions are now offering fully online degree programs. Yet it is not clear how students who enroll in fully online degree programs are similar to those students who enroll in in-person (&quot;traditional&quot;) degree programs. Because previous work has shown students' attitudes toward science can affect their performance in a course, it is valuable to ask how attitudes toward science differ between these two populations. We studied students who completed a fully online astrobiology course. In an analysis of 451 student responses to the Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience survey, we found online program students began the course with a higher scientific sophistication and a higher sense of personal value of science than those in traditional programs. Precourse attitudes also showed some predictive power of course grades among online students, but not for traditional students. Given established relationships between feelings of personal value, intrinsic motivation, and, in turn, traits such as persistence, our results suggest that open-ended or exploration-based learning may be more engaging to online program students due to their pre-existing attitudes. The converse may also be true, that certain pre-existing attitudes among online program students are more detrimental than they are for traditional program students.",

        "description":"In a European project--CoReflect--researchers in seven countries are developing, implementing and evaluating teaching sequences using a web-based platform (STOCHASMOS). The interactive web-based inquiry materials support collaborative and reflective work. The learning environments will be iteratively tested and refined, during different phases of the project. All learning environments are focusing &quot;socio-scientific issues&quot;. In this article we report from the pilot implementation of the Swedish learning environment which has an Astrobiology context. The socio-scientific driving questions are &quot;Should we look for, and try to contact, extraterrestrial life?&quot;, and &quot;Should we transform Mars into a planet where humans can live in the future?&quot; The students were in their last year of compulsory school (16 years old), and worked together in triads. We report from the groups' decisions and the support used for their claims. On a group level a majority of the student groups in their final statements express reluctance towards both the search of extraterrestrial life and the terraforming of Mars. The support used by the students are reported and discussed. We also look more closely into the argumentation of one of the student groups. The results presented in this article, differ from earlier studies on students' argumentation and decision making on socio-scientific issues (Aikenhead in &quot;Science education for everyday life. Evidence-based practice.&quot; Teachers College Press, New York, (2006) for an overview), in that they suggest that students do use science related arguments--both from &quot;core&quot; and &quot;frontier&quot; science--in their argumentation and decision making.",
