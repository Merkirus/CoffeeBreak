        "author":["Zorochkina, Tetiana"],
        "description":"The article deals with legal enforcement of teacher education in Great Britain. It has been found out that in Great Britain, the sources of education legislation are statutes and acts adopted by British government. All current statutes relating to education are classified either as public or private. Public laws contain general rules, that is, designed for all individuals and for repeated application. They operate throughout the country, addressed to all subjects of educational relations. Private statutes accumulate private norms, which refer to specific legal entities or individuals and contain strictly defined directives for them. They are addressed to a particular country or specific organization or group of individuals. It has been indicated that the system of education legislation in Great Britain in the context of teacher education is provided by a range of legal acts, such as the Education Reform Act of 1988, the Further and Higher Education Act of 1992, by the Teaching and Higher Education Act of 1998, The Education Act 2002, The Education Act of 2005, The Education and Inspections Act of 2006, The Education and Skills Act of 2008, The Education Act of 2011, The Education and Adoption Act 2016, The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 as well as legal acts of European authorities. It has been concluded that the orientation of the content of British legal acts toward quality teacher training should be successfully implemented into Ukrainian education legislation so that the national system of teacher training may be improved. It has been suggested that the prospects for further researchers are seen in studying the legal enforcement of teacher education in leading European countries (Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Switzerland etc.).",

        "description":"Physical educators have at their disposal basketballs, jump ropes, cones and other types of equipment to assist student learning during physical education class time. Recently, a new product has been introduced to physical educators: cup stacks, which are cups made of thick durable plastic. They are intended to help improve ambidexterity, quickness, concentration, and handeye coordination (Fox, 2001). In the few years that cup stacks have been used in elementary physical education classes, students have been found to enjoy using them during class activities. While the overall acceptance of cup stacks has been favorable with students, recent literature has raised questions about cup stacks and their place as an activity in physical education. In this article, the authors contend that using cup stacks can help to improve the self-esteem of students who may not have been successful in other traditional physical education activities, therefore it can be considered an activity with great potential. The purpose of this article is to suggest activities to teachers who already use cup stacks in physical education. (Contains 3 figures.)",

        "description":"An introductory physics experiment has been developed to address the issues seen in conventional physics lab classes including assumption verification, technological dependencies, and real world motivation for the experiment. The experiment has little technology dependence and compares the acceleration due to gravity by using position versus time graphs and the kinematic equation. The students are then asked to compare the acceleration they found to the one of a Porsche car which they seem surprised when they learn about it. This experiment may contribute significantly to the understanding of the concept of acceleration and the appreciation for the force of gravity.",

        "description":"In the field of geographical and environmental education, maps and geo-referenced information are frequently used, in which the earth's surfaces are represented in a two-dimensional (2D) way. Students have difficulty interpreting the relief representation and switching between 2D and 3D scenarios. Digital terrain modelling is added to the traditional cartographic techniques to represent the landforms, and the AR technology provides a new 3D and mapping human-machine interaction. In the 2015-2016 course, an educational experiment using AR on a tablet with 63 students from La Laguna University was performed covering three steps: academic improvement, usability of this technology to interpret the relief, and if it is motivating for the students. This paper presents the results in usability and motivation. A usability study in terms of efficiency, efficacy and satisfaction is presented. To assess student motivation, the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory motivational model with six dimensions is adopted. Results about AR on tablets in the interpretation of terrain relief show a great usability of this technology, which serves as a motivational tool for the 3D visualization.",

But there are also unanswered questions such as: how is it possible that a pedagogical experiment begun in the United States in February 1920 had, by the month of March, already come to be known first hand by a visiting English educator? The objective in this article is to find an explanation for the rapid expansion and huge popularity of the Dalton Plan in Great Britain in the early 1920s. This is attempted theoretically by using the concepts 'educational network' and 'pedagogical product', and empirically by using unexplored documents and correspondence concerning Helen Parkhurst's trips to Great Britain. It ends with the conclusion that, in Great Britain, as early as 1922, the Dalton Plan became a commercial product that was exploited in similar ways to the work of Maria Montessori.",

The role of public authorities and civil communities of Great Britain in providing financing, monitoring and defining requirements for interprofessional learning in the field of physiotherapists' training has been considered. Positive results and the significance of use of interprofessional learning in physiotherapists' training to improve interprofessional communication and collabouration for more effective health services that meet the modern needs of British society have been marked out. Project tasks that will ensure the development and implementation of innovative interprofessional clinical bases of learning in the field of health care in Great Britain have been analyzed.
