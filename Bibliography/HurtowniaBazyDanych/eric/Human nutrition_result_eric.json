        "description":"This document is the sixth annual, legislatively mandated report on the human nutrition research and education activities of the United States Department of Agriculture for fiscal year 1992 in which directions and highlights are emphasized. The report contains six sections. Section 1 is an introduction. Section 2 covers human nutrition research activities. This section notes new research projects, research highlights and other research findings during 1992. Overall human nutrition research and education activities continued to be linked with the nutritive value of foods, human nutritional needs, the kinds and amounts of foods that Americans consume relative to their needs, and the strategies for improving diets and the food supply. Section 3 describes nutrition education and  information programs which include the Cooperative Extension Service and the Food and Nutrition Service, a federal funding source for nutrition education that serves a variety of programs. Section 4 contains information on funding levels for 1986-93. The total amount of financial support from the Department increased from $60.7 million in 1986 to $76.1 million in 1992, an increase of 25 percent. Section 5 describes coordination and advisory mechanisms. Section 6 summarizes the potential benefits of improved diets and nutritional status. (JB)",
