        "description":"This review is one of a series of assessments and reviews prepared in the public interest by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). The purpose of this review is to outline the potential achievements of solar system exploration and suggest a course of action which will maximize the rewards to mankind. A secondary purpose is to provide a sourcebook of information on the solar system and the technology being brought to bear for its exploration. The purpose of solar system exploration is presented and our present knowledge of the solar system is reviewed. Photographs, tabulated data, schematic drawings, and detailed descriptions of each planet are presented with this topic. A chapter presenting some of the technology that has been developed to further solar  exploration is included in the review. A final chapter presents the implementation of a solar system exploration program, beginning with missions already approved and scheduled by NASA and suggesting further programs. (Author/EB)",

The unit begins when students attempt to decode a fictitious message from outer space. Imagining that they are SETI scientists, students begin to analyze where in our solar system and beyond there may be conditions favorable for life. Students investigate how our solar system and other planetary systems may have formed, and consider how information about our solar system fits into a bigger picture of the universe. This book includes background information for teachers and diverse resources. Teachers do not need to  have special knowledge of astronomy to present this unit successfully. (WRM)",

        "description":"Exploring the Solar System in the elementary school curriculum has traditionally involved activities, such as building scale models, to help students visualize the vastness of space and the relative size of the planets and their orbits. Today, numerous websites provide a wealth of information about the sun and the planets, combining text, photos, and graphics, and even interactive models. Some sites also include lesson plans and suggested classroom activities. Yet none of these resources allow for development of a lesson plan interactively, or offer tracking of student performance. Many lesson plans also have materials or space requirements that are impractical for some schools. SpaceSafari is an interactive multimedia software program for learning about the solar system that integrates information, exploration, and instruction. It employs a real-time 3D space for navigation, a module for learning about the planets, and an administrative interface for creating activities and tracking student progress. The design of the software resembles a first-person adventure game: a treasure hunt through the solar system in which the missions are created by the teacher. SpaceSafari was developed for both the formal (classroom) and informal (home) learning spaces, with a choice of input modes and display options. This integrated solution for teaching elementary Astronomy using personal computers poses an intriguing research question: &quot;What is the impact of game mechanics, combined with an immersive, kinesthetic, 3D interface, on learning outcomes about the solar system?&quot; (Contains 3 figures.)",

The units consist of basic introductory information and questions, worksheets, a self-checking quiz, and instructions for experiments. A cumulative test is provided at the end of the workbook, along with a glossary. The teachers guide  (which is included) explains how to use the workbook, together with teaching suggestions and enrichment activities for each unit. (TW)",

        "description":"The nature of students' ideas about the scientific practices used by astronomers when studying objects in our Solar System is of widespread interest to discipline-based astronomy education researchers. A sample of middle-school, high-school, and college students (N = 42) in the U.S. were interviewed about how astronomers were able to learn about properties of the Solar System as a follow-up question after specific questions about the nature of the Solar System and its objects. These students often held naive ideas about the practices of astronomy, and 19% of them proposed that humans or robots have returned samples of the planets to Earth for analysis. While the college students provided more sophisticated responses to the questions than the younger students, we found that even they held naive ideas about human sample return and infrequently appealed to studying objects at a distance using telescopes. We propose that students are not receiving specific instruction that allows them to investigate the tools and practices of astronomy, which leads them to rely on their prior knowledge about science practices in other disciplines (e.g., geoscience) when queried about how scientists study the Solar System. This result implies that instruction around the limits of human and robotic spaceflight is needed to allow students to have a more scientific understanding of the practices of astronomy in studying the Solar System.",
