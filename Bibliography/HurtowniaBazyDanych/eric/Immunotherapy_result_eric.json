        "description":"Various treatments for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are described, focusing on the role of exercise. Some physicians prefer to try exercise and others, lifestyle changes before turning to such treatment as psychoactive drugs, vitamin B complex, dopamine agonists, and immunotherapy. Regular exercise has been shown to relieve symptoms of PMS. (SM)",

        "author":["McCabe, Paul C."],
        "description":"This article is the second of a two-part series on allergic rhinitis (AR). Treatments for AR are now widely available in both prescription and over-the-counter form. The medication therapies include antihistamines, decongestants, leukotriene receptor antagonists, cromolyn sodium, and immunotherapy. Corticosteroids are also used via nasal inhalants. Treatment for seasonal AR is recommended to begin several weeks before the onset of allergy season and continue for several weeks after it ends, while perennial AR should be treated year-round. Although many treatments for AR are effective in abating primary symptoms, they may induce significant side effects (particularly sedation) that impact attention, arousal, and learning. This article reviews the efficacy and concomitant side effects of two of the more common treatments for AR--antihistamine therapy and corticosteroid therapy--and concludes with implications for school psychologists, who are often at the nexus of students' learning, behavior, and health issues while coping with AR.

        "description":"Meta-analysis allows researchers to combine evidence from multiple studies, making it a powerful tool for synthesizing information on the safety profiles of new medical interventions. There is a critical need to identify subgroups at high risk of experiencing treatment-related toxicities. However, this remains quite challenging from a statistical perspective as there are a variety of clinical risk factors that may be relevant for different types of adverse events, and adverse events of interest may be rare or incompletely reported. We frame this challenge as a variable selection problem and propose a Bayesian hierarchical model which incorporates a horseshoe prior on the interaction terms to identify high-risk groups. Our proposed model is motivated by a meta-analysis of adverse events in cancer immunotherapy, and our results uncover key factors driving the risk of specific types of treatment-related adverse events.",

The aim of this study was to develop a more practical alternative for identifying major cognitive delay in infants at the age of 24 months, based on parental reports. Method: A sample of 476 infants (206 female, 270 male) previously diagnosed with neonatal sepsis (mean birthweight 1329g [SD 865g], mean gestational age at birth 28.7wks [SD 4.5wks]) from the International Neonatal Immunotherapy Study were assessed using the Parent Report of Children's Abilities--Revised and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition. Logistic regression was used to model the association between the risk of major cognitive delay (i.e. Bayley Scales of Infant Development Mental Development Index less than 55) and the Parent Report of Children's Abilities--Revised data. Results: The receiver operating characteristic curves for a number of predictive models were constructed--each achieved an area under the curve of at least 90%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of a number of points on the receiver operating characteristic curves are presented. Interpretation: The Parent Report of Children's Abilities--Revised is a practical tool for identifying major cognitive delay in infants at 24 months.",

        "description":"Due to its impact on society, the design of new drugs has the potential to interest a wide audience, and provides a rare opportunity to introduce several concepts in chemistry and biochemistry. Drug design can be seen as a multiobjective cyclic optimization process. Indeed, it is important to develop the understanding not only that a drug is generally an effective ligand for a protein of therapeutic interest, but also that these molecules need to have drug-like properties. Computer-aided drug design and bioinformatics approaches play a fundamental role in addressing these different challenges. Here we introduce a new freely available integrated web-based educational tool, Drug Design Workshop, which presents the basics of drug design and provides anyone with access to computational methods and resources to conceive and evaluate molecules for their potential to become actual drugs. We provide 3 examples of drug design targets for the discovery of common or state-of-the-art drugs, which can be used by educators to introduce easily the different concepts related to drug discovery: anti-inflammatory agents and drugs for immunotherapy or targeted cancer therapy. Since 2015, the workshop has been successfully given to over 1,500 people. The Web site was optimized on the basis of the positive and constructive comments from high-school teachers and students (15-19 years old).",

        "description":"Seattle Children's Research Institute has built a series of in-person education programs to inspire and empower students to explore futures in biomedical research and healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic prevented us from offering an in-person laboratory program, forcing a rapid pivot to an online format. The Virtual Research Training Program (VRTP) was a one-week summer experience for high school students, including students from groups that are under-represented in STEM. The curriculum introduced topics such as biochemistry, immunology and immunotherapy, and global and public health. Also included were laboratory demonstrations to emphasize cutting-edge applications for healthcare and discussions regarding college and career preparation. Key challenges included converting the in-person curriculum into a digestible virtual format, becoming proficient with the technology to provide for a seamless end-user experience with equitable access, and establishing quantifiable metrics for evaluation. Students reported statistically significant gains with large effect sizes in knowledge about science concepts and laboratory procedures, and in preparation for college and future STEM careers. Students were also engaged by asking questions, indicating their active participation despite the online environment. This article discusses the adaptation of an in-person laboratory program into a virtual program as a potential model for increasing remote access to science education.",
