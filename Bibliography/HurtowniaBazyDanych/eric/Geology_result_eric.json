        "description":"We present a quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of a newly developed introductory course, Geology of Mexico, in attracting Hispanic students, encouraging them to take more geology courses, and recruiting them to the major. The student population in the Geology of Mexico course was 93% Hispanic compared with 18.5% in Physical Geology. We found that Hispanic students in Physical Geology earned lower grades than did nonminority students, while Hispanic students in Geology of Mexico earned grades comparable with nonminority students in Physical Geology. Overall, Geology of Mexico students also showed more positive attitude changes and were more likely to take another geology course. The recruitment rate into the major for Hispanic students in Geology of Mexico was 4.7% compared with 3% in Physical Geology. The recruitment rate for nonminority students in Physical Geology was 4.9%. We believe the difference in outcome for Hispanic students is due to a strong cohort effect enhanced by (1) the required lab component and (2) many students knowing one another because they belong to the Hispanic-serving organizations on campus that promote our course.",

        "description":"In 1991, a survey questionnaire concerning undergraduate education in geology was sent to a nationally representative sample of 597 four-year colleges and universities. Of these, 275 had an undergraduate geology department or a department with a geology program, and met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Responses were received from 262 of the 275 eligible institutions. The data were weighted to provide national estimates about instruction staff, computer resources, course offerings, and issues and concerns in undergraduate education in geology. Some of the highlighted results included the following. Almost all research universities (92%) had geology programs, but only 68% of doctoral institutions and much smaller portions of comprehensive (40%) and liberal arts  institutions (15%) offered geology programs. Bachelor's degrees were offered by 88% of the departments with geology programs, 42% offered master's degrees, 23% offered doctorates, and 3% associate's degrees. Almost two-thirds (63%) of the departments stated that the number of students who declared a major in geology increased in the last 5 years. In evaluating the six components of undergraduate education in geology, department chairs assessed curriculum and faculty/staff resources more positively than they did laboratory equipment for undergraduate instruction, facilities, student preparation, and teaching assistants. A large majority (80%) stated they offered undergraduate geology students access to departmental computers for undergraduate research and coursework. (PR)",

We examined the reasons why undergraduate geology students chose to major in geology, with a particular emphasis on women. We collected data from 391 undergraduate students (46.4% women) enrolled in six geology departments at public, four-year institutions across the United States. Students reported six reasons they were attracted to geology: interest, career opportunities, liking the outdoors, liking the department, being encouraged by someone, and other. Interest was the most frequent reason female and male students reported for being attracted to geology. After interest, liking the geology department (including liking classes, faculty, and the department overall) was the next most frequent reason female students reported for selecting a geology major. It was the second to least frequent reason for male students. Both female and male students in departments graduating a higher percentage of women more frequently reported liking the department as a reason for being attracted to geology than did students in departments graduating lower percentages of women. Geology departments have the potential to impact the recruitment and retention of students, particularly women, into their programs. Future research is needed to identify the specific department practices that attract female students and provide a more welcoming climate to students.",

        "description":"Past research has evaluated how preservice teachers, high school students, and introductory college students conceptualize geologic or deep time. The ability to think on geologic timescales is regarded as an important skill in the study of geology, yet little work has specifically addressed how student understanding of this concept evolves during the undergraduate experience and beyond. We describe an exploratory, preexperimental study conducted at a large research university investigating student knowledge of various Earth history and geologic time concepts among geology majors. A 21-question pre/posttest was constructed to assess concepts related to landscape identification, landscape formation rates, Earth history, the geologic timescale, and relative and absolute dating. Pre/posttesting was conducted across four semesters within a variety of courses including historical geology, structural geology, geomorphology, and a geology field camp course. Data were also collected from a group of nonmajors in an introductory physical geology course to obtain a novice score and from a group of faculty expert geoscientists at the Geological Society of America annual meeting to obtain an expert score on the instrument. Additionally, interviews were conducted with 11 senior geology majors to gain a deeper understanding of their conceptions related to a sample of the concepts assessed. Results show that students make the largest gains after taking physical and historical geology courses, but no significant changes were seen in upper-level geology courses. Many geology students lacked familiarity with the geologic timescale and had difficulty estimating formation rates of landscapes formed on intermediate timespans.",
