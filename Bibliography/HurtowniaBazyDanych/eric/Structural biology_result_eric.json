        "description":"Understanding the basic principles of structural biology is becoming a major subject of study in most undergraduate level programs in biology. In the genomic and proteomic age, it is becoming indispensable for biology students to master concepts related to the sequence and structure of proteins in order to develop skills that may be useful in a wide range of applications. Within this context, this article shows a scheme for teaching structural biology based on hands-on computer approaches, including computational genomics, and structural bioinformatics tools. The students learn to use most of the leading computer programs available for the complete path that goes from sequence to structure and eventually function. During the course, they are taught to build models of proteins based on sequence and structure information. The students are also provided with a critical point of view on automatic procedures and learn to discern between likely and unlikely structures of their final models.

        "description":"Although virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) techniques have been used extensively in specialized laboratories, only recently did they become affordable, reaching wider consumer markets. With increased availability, it is timely to examine the roles that VR and AR may play in teaching structural biology and in experiencing complex data sets such as macromolecular structures. This guide is suitable for those teachers of structural biology who do not have a deep knowledge of information technologies. This study focuses on three questions: 1) How can teachers of structural biology produce and disseminate VR/AR-ready educational material with established and user-friendly software tools?; 2) What are the positive and negative experiences reported by test participants when performing identical learning tasks in the VR and AR environments?; and 3) How do the test participants perceive prerecorded narration during VR/AR exploration?",

        "description":"This study reports the findings of a study which examined the relationship between conceptions of learning and approaches to learning in biology. This study, which used structural equation modelling, also sorted to identify gender differences in the relationship. Two questionnaires, the Conceptions of Learning Biology (COLB) and the Approaches to Learning Biology (ALB), were developed to investigate 582 undergraduate biology majors' (275 females and 307 males) conceptions of and approaches to learning biology, respectively. The results indicate a general trend that, while the students possessing lower-level COLB, &quot;Memorizing&quot;, &quot;Testing&quot;, and &quot;Calculating and Practising&quot;, tend to adopt a surface approach to learning in biology, the students expressing higher-level conceptions, &quot;Increasing one's knowledge&quot;, &quot;Application&quot;, and &quot;Understanding and seeing in a new way&quot;, are more likely to adopt a deep approach to learning in biology. This study also found several salient gender differences in the COLB, as well as in the way in which the COLB affected the ALB. For example, female students tended to express more sophisticated COLB than male students. The &quot;Memorizing&quot; conception of learning biology held by male students is inclined to engender both deep motive and deep strategy, but this tendency was not found among the female students.

Three questionnaires, the Epistemological Beliefs, the Conceptions of Learning Biology and the Self-efficacy for Learning Biology, have been used to investigate 384 high school students' epistemological beliefs, conceptions of learning, and self-efficacy for learning biology, respectively.The results indicate that the students' epistemological beliefs about the source/certainty, justification, and development of biology knowledge have some direct and positive relations with some factors of conceptions of learning. Moreover, it has been found that those students' epistemological beliefs about justification and development, and their conceptions of learning about applying, understanding, and seeing in a new way directly and positively relate to the students' self-efficacy for learning. Only the source/certainty of knowledge directly and negatively relates to the students' self-efficacy. In addition, the students' epistemological beliefs play an indirect role in the students' self efficacy through the mediator of conceptions of learning. It can be said that all these information about the students' epistemological beliefs, conceptions of learning, and self-efficacy for biology learning are required for an effective teaching and learning process.",

        "description":"This study investigated the relationships among college students' epistemic beliefs in biology (EBB), conceptions of learning biology (COLB), and strategies of learning biology (SLB). EBB includes four dimensions, namely &quot;multiple-source,&quot; &quot;uncertainty,&quot; &quot;development,&quot; and &quot;justification.&quot; COLB is further divided into &quot;constructivist&quot; and &quot;reproductive&quot; conceptions, while SLB represents deep strategies and surface learning strategies. Questionnaire responses were gathered from 303 college students. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling showed acceptable model fits. Mediation testing further revealed two paths with complete mediation. In sum, students' epistemic beliefs of &quot;uncertainty&quot; and &quot;justification&quot; in biology were statistically significant in explaining the constructivist and reproductive COLB, respectively; and &quot;uncertainty&quot; was statistically significant in explaining the deep SLB as well. The results of mediation testing further revealed that &quot;uncertainty&quot; predicted surface strategies through the mediation of &quot;reproductive&quot; conceptions; and the relationship between &quot;justification&quot; and deep strategies was mediated by &quot;constructivist&quot; COLB. This study provides evidence for the essential roles some epistemic beliefs play in predicting students' learning.",

High school biology courses are frequently where students are introduced to organic molecules and their importance to cellular chemistry. However, structural representations are often intimidating because students have not been introduced to the language. As part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) GK-12 program, we designed and implemented a classroom activity to help students become familiar with the symbolic nature of bond-line structures and to gain experience in recognizing distinctive features among classes of organic molecules. Odorant molecules associated with food are engaging vehicles for students to make structural observations and practice pattern recognition for the discovery of functional groups; they also learn the rules for unwritten carbon and hydrogen atoms. Introducing the molecular nature of odors and the associated smells provides a tangible chemistry-biology connection that stimulates students' interests in organic chemistry while learning the structural language used by practicing chemists.

        "description":"Structural molecular biology is now becoming part of high school science curriculum thus posing a challenge for teachers who need to convey three-dimensional (3D) structures with conventional text and pictures. In many cases even interactive computer graphics does not go far enough to address these challenges. We have developed a flexible model of the polypeptide backbone using 3D printing technology. With this model we have produced a polypeptide assembly kit to create an idealized model of the Triosephosphate isomerase mutase enzyme (TIM), which forms a structure known as TIM barrel. This kit has been used in a laboratory practical where students perform a step-by-step investigation into the nature of protein folding, starting with the handedness of amino acids to the formation of secondary and tertiary structure. Based on the classroom evidence we collected, we conclude that these models are a valuable and inexpensive resource for teaching structural molecular biology.",

        "description":"Structural biology education commonly employs molecular visualization software, such as PyMol, RasMol, and VMD, to allow students to appreciate structure--function relationships in biomolecules. In on-ground, classroom-based education, these programs are commonly used on University-owned devices with software preinstalled. Remote education typically involves the use of student-owned devices, which complicates the use of such software, owing to the fact that (a) student devices have differing configurations (e.g., Windows vs MacOS) and processing power, and (b) not all student devices are suitable for use with such software. Smartphones are near-ubiquitous devices, with smartphone ownership exceeding personal computer ownership, according to a recent survey. Here, we show the use of a smartphone-based augmented reality app, Augment, in a structural biology classroom exercise, which students installed independently without IT support. Post-lab attitudinal survey results indicate positive student experiences with this app. Based on our experiences, we suggest that smartphone-based molecular visualization software, such as that used in this exercise, is a powerful educational tool that is particularly well-suited for use in remote education.",

This activity brings easily acquired plant specimens into the classroom to tackle common alternative conceptions regarding life, size, complexity, the nature of science, and plants as multicellular organisms. The activity occurs after a discussion of the characteristics of life and engages students in application of course content and utilization of scientific thinking. It is appropriate for any class in which the nature of life and its structural complexities are addressed and in which teachers want to help students gain familiarity with plants as multicellular organisms.",
