After their classroom preparation, students went to a local zoo to observe the behavior of the animal they chose in both normal (nonenriched) and enriched environments and developed animal data cards for zookeepers to use in educational programs. Results showed that after participating in the zoo laboratory, students reported significant attitude changes, including more positive attitudes toward studying animals and increased confidence in their observational abilities. The laboratory provides a foundation for more extensive animal research and internship projects.",

Individual animals react in ways that are a combination of instinct and learned behavior, but collectively they exhibit broader tendencies that can be discussed in terms of ecology, animal behavior, and natural selection. The binary choice activities detailed in this article encourage inquiry by fostering student engagement and purposeful learning through an investigation of animal environmental preferences.
