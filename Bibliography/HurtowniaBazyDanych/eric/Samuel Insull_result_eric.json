        "author":["Olasky, Marvin N."],
        "description":"The development of modern public relations is traced in this paper. The opposition of James Madison and his colleagues to involving the federal government in projects of &quot;public interest&quot; because they had seen the system abused by British authorities is explained, and the efforts of nineteenth century leaders within the railroad industry to obtain grants for their projects and the philosophies of those men are explored. Twentieth century executives such as Theodore Vail and Samuel Insull, leaders in the telephone and electric utility industries, are discussed. Three generalizations about the developments in public relations in the past several decades are made. Finally, the paper compares two large United States companies and their public relations policies. The conclusion  asserts that it is time to address the basic issues of public relations, and of much of economics also: What is public? What is private? (DF)",

Sandall); (4) \"Classroom Models of Individualized Instruction\" (Eva Horn, Joan Lieber, Susan R. Sandall, Ilene S. Schwartz, and Ruth A. Wolery); (5) \"Social Relationships of Children with Disabilities and Their Peers in Inclusive Preschool Classrooms\" (Samuel L. Odom, Craig Zercher, Jules Marquart, Shouming Li, Susan R. Sandall, and Pamela Wolfberg); (6) \"Collaborative Relationships among Adults in Inclusive Preschool Programs\" (Joan Lieber, Ruth A. Wolery, Eva Horn, Jennifer Tschantz, Paula J. Beckman, and Marci J. Hanson); (7) \"Family Perceptions of Inclusion\" (Paula J. Beckman, Marci J. Hanson, and Eva Horn); (8) \"Community  Participation of Children with Disabilities\" (Paula J.

Samuel Head found limitations in his Year 13 students' understanding of how and why historians arrive at differing interpretations, which impeded their ability to analyse them. He set about tackling this with carefully sequenced planning and a processual model using the visual metaphor of an iceberg. Samuel and his department also developed a long-term curriculum plan to build students' disciplinary knowledge of interpretations from Year 7 onwards.",
