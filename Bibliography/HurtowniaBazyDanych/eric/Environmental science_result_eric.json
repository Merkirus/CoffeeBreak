        "description":"The International Environmental Education Programme (IEEP) of UNESCO has developed a series of teacher training modules in environmental education. This experimental module focuses on the pre-service training of secondary school science teachers and supervisors. The six chapters of the document address: (1) the environmental problem and education's response; (2) the connections between science education and environmental education (including basic skills in science and environmental education and the relationship of science, society and technology); (3) curriculum tasks in environmental education for science teachers (particularly those relating to environmental problem solving and action strategies); (4) teaching strategies and activities; (5) evaluation of environmental  education programs (with regard to societal aspects of science learning and instructional materials); and (6) the implementation of environmental education at both the school building and school district levels. The appendices contain a listing of science concepts of particular importance in environmental education, definitions and aims of environmental education, the declaration of the Tbilisi Intergovernmental Conference on Environmental Education, a description of IEEP, and a bibliography.

        "author":["Littledyke, Michael"],
        "description":"Science education has an important part in developing understanding of concepts that underpin environmental issues, leading potentially to pro-environmental behaviour. However, science is commonly perceived negatively, leading to inappropriate and negative models of science that do not connect to people's experiences. The article argues that the cognitive and affective domains need to be explicitly integrated in a science education that informs environmental education, as a sense of relationship is essential for environmental care and responsibility leading to informed action. The features of such approaches to science education are discussed through analysis of the impact of modern and constructive postmodern science education models on environmental education, and possible strategies for making connections between cognitive and affective domains are proposed. The analysis incorporates the development of positive approaches to science and environmental issues through teacher modelling of biophilic behaviour, active learning through constructivist pedagogy, the politicisation of science education to address social and environmental issues, suitable experiences of natural environments and living organisms, and science curricula that emphasise conceptual integration to demonstrate complex environmental effects, including the environmental consequences of human behaviour.

Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses found self-efficacy, outcome expectations, role model influence, perceived supports and barriers, and environmental concerns contributed significant variance to the prediction of these students' interest in environmental science. When compared with White students, ethnic minority students perceived greater barriers to pursuing a career in environmental science, exhibited less concern about environmental problems, and had less interest in environmental science.
