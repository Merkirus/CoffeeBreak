        "title":"School District Cabinet Member Task and Relationship Conflict Behavior during Budget Development in a State Fiscal Crisis",
        "author":["Nickerson, John"],
        "description":"Purpose. The first purpose of this study was to determine to what extent task and relationship conflict occurred in school district cabinets during budget development in a state budget crisis. The second purpose was to determine which cabinet member task and relationship conflict behaviors were demonstrated during budget development in a state budget crisis.    Methodology. An expert panel selected twelve school districts based on behaviors indicative of effective teamwork and successful conflict and budget management. A mixed-methods approach was used to obtain quantitative and qualitative data. Eighty-one cabinet member interviews and seventy-eight questionnaires comprised the data set. Questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Interviews and open-ended questionnaire data were analyzed using qualitative methods.    Findings. Data analysis confirmed that sample district cabinets demonstrated productive conflict behaviors during the 2008-2009 budget development cycle. Cabinet members frequently demonstrated specific behaviors that led to intragroup trust, focus on district superordinate goals, group meeting norms, positive encouragement, and acknowledgement of productive task conflict. Additional findings suggest: (1) humor and cabinet membership longevity were an interpersonal dynamic that contributed to productive conflict behaviors, and (2) cabinets maintained an environment of participant equity and access during budget problem solving. Conclusions. District cabinet members who exhibit strong intragroup trust, focus on district superordinate goals, follow established conflict norms, and encourage discussion of conflicting budget solution alternatives are more likely to demonstrate moderate levels of productive task conflict and low levels of detrimental relationship conflict during their budget development process.    Implications for Action. Given the educational challenges and the anticipated resource scarcity facing California public schools, district cabinets need to develop innovative and strategic budget solution alternatives. Productive task conflict will help facilitate better financial decisions. To encourage productive task conflict, it is suggested that cabinet members: (1) engage in activities which build intragroup trust; (2) use district superordinate goals to guide the budget development process; (3) implement and practice group norms that encourage productive conflict; (4) overtly encourage debate about budget solution alternatives; (5) positively acknowledge dissenting opinions; (6) provide agenda and relevant data prior to cabinet meetings; and (7) use meeting facilitation skills and structuring devices to promote opportunities to exchange ideas.

The number of immigrants to Estonia has been remarkable in the second half of the century. The population in Estonia is divided into two parts: Estonian (66%) and non-Estonians (34%). The composition of the population and the language situation in Estonia do not make it possible to use the experience of any other country in Europe; Estonia has to find its own way in the area of civic education and language strategy. From the point of view of the Republic of Estonia, it is very important to foster variable multilingualism (integration of the non-Estonian population into the Estonian society) and to develop the international communication (European integration). In 1997, the Estonian  Language Strategy document had been compiled. The Republic of Estonia needs one certain language strategy that would be complemented in case of need. (Author/VWL)",

        "description":"A significant body of research from business and industry has generally confirmed the contribution of participative decision-making to improved organizational effectiveness and employee morale. Following a literature review, this paper explores the implementation of shared decision-making in the Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) Public Schools. The conceptual framework, assumptions, and operational characteristics of the instructional cabinet are presented. The principal and the instructional teacher leader's roles are reviewed, along with the training methods employed. Since 1981, Pittsburgh has invested heavily in staff development to achieve school improvement and cost effective management. Pittsburgh desired to create a climate where faculty participation resulted in shared  responsibility for improved decision-making, increased professional satisfaction, and greater commitment to the total school community. The instructional cabinet was designed to: (1) improve collegiality among professionals; (2) create a dynamic community of learners; and (3) promote continued school renewal. The administrator assists staff development personnel in providing necessary training for teachers to acquire, practice, and evaluate the skills of cabinet members as the group engages in shared decision-making. Two proposed studies involving instructional cabinet group interactions and the instructional teacher leader are described. If shared decision-making is to lead to greater professionalism, researchers must carefully document the process and studies must relate processes to  outcomes. (17 references) (MLH)",

        "author":["Miller, James R."],
        "description":"The paper traces the period 1945-65 when scholars of the American presidency changed their emphasis from the study of individual presidents to examination of the presidency itself and the powers it encompassed. The change was prompted by events such as World War II, development of the atomic bomb, and the Cold War. Evidence that mankind was capable of self-destruction and the threat of nuclear war led scholars to examine the powers of the presidency in shaping policy and leading the public. Contrary to traditional thinking, it was observed that the Presidential Cabinet was not a unified group. Richard Fenno (\"The President's Cabinet,\" 1959) found that each cabinet member fends for himself with little consideration for cabinet unity. Also, cabinet members tend to develop their own  lines of power which may conflict with objectives of the administration. Several studies revealed that the President does not necessarily stand at the head of his party and that his leadership is not essential to the proper functioning of the party on all levels. Rather, it appears that both parties contain wings which support either the President or the Congress. One analysis of the relationship between the President and Congress showed that Congress initiated more legislation than did the President. In terms of foreign policy, the President became a figure of international leadership following World War II. (Author/AV)",
