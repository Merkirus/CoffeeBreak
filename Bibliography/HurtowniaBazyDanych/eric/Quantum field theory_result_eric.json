        "description":"We show that many of the key ideas of quantum field theory can be illustrated simply and straightforwardly by using toy models in (0 + 1) dimensions. Because quantum field theory in (0 + 1) dimensions is equivalent to quantum mechanics, these models allow us to use techniques from quantum mechanics to gain insight into quantum field theory. In addition, working in (0 + 1) dimensions considerably simplifies the mathematics, allowing the physical concepts involved to be exhibited more clearly. (Contains 17 footnotes and 4 figures.)",

        "author":["Hobson, Art"],
        "description":"An earlier paper introduces quantum physics by means of four experiments: Youngs double-slit interference experiment using (1) a light beam, (2) a low-intensity light beam with time-lapse photography, (3) an electron beam, and (4) a low-intensity electron beam with time-lapse photography. It's ironic that, although these experiments demonstrate most of the quantum fundamentals, conventional pedagogy stresses their difficult and paradoxical nature. These paradoxes (i.e., logical contradictions) vanish, and understanding becomes simpler, if one takes seriously the fact that quantum mechanics is the nonrelativistic limit of our most accurate physical theory, namely quantum field theory, and treats the Schroedinger wave function, as well as the electromagnetic field, as quantized fields. Both the Schroedinger field, or \"matter field,\" and the EM field are made of \"quanta\"--spatially extended but energetically discrete chunks or bundles of energy. Each quantum comes nonlocally from the entire space-filling field and interacts with macroscopic systems such as the viewing screen by collapsing into an atom instantaneously and randomly in accordance with the probability amplitude specified by the field. Thus, uncertainty and nonlocality are inherent in quantum physics. This paper is about quantum uncertainty. A planned later paper will take up quantum nonlocality.",

        "description":"Current education paradigms were informed by the classical Newtonian worldview of brain functioning in which the mind is simply the physical activity of the brain, and our thoughts cannot have any effect upon the physical world. However, researchers in the field of quantum mechanics found that the outcomes of certain subatomic experiments are determined by the consciousness of the observer, leading philosophers to propose that the observed and the observer are linked. Quantum mechanics also demonstrates that distant minds may behave in simultaneous correlational ways, in the absence of being linked through any known energetic signal. Further, researchers in this field propose that an external memory space is operating in the human brain, suggesting that this proposed external memory space may be a quantum field surrounding the brain and interacting with other fields, generating a global mental field of information flow. This article proposes that current education paradigms, which have been informed by a classical Newtonian physics worldview may need to be expanded to include a quantum mechanics worldview. The author seeks to understand if, and how, quantum mechanics could inform education practices, theories and paradigms and invites discussion, debate and speculation on the implications this would have for education systems.",

        "description":"This paper builds upon a foundational paper (under review) which explores the rudiments of the quantum perspective of learning. The quantum perspective of learning uses the principles of exchange theory or borrowed theory from the field of quantum holism pioneered by quantum physicist David Bohm (1971, 1973) to understand learning in a new way. Bohm proposes that everything exists as wholes, rather than as parts, and that everything is connected. Similarly, the quantum perspective of learning proposes that individuals learn in holistic ways as they interact with temporal and in infinitely extending virtual worlds. Further, according to the quantum perspective of learning, learners have infinite potential. In this paper, the quantum perspective of learning is examined utilizing a combination of Schunk's (1991) and Ertmer and Newby's (1993) definitive questions for aligning learning theory with instructional design. These seven definitive questions focus on how learning happens, influential factors in learning, the role of memory, transfer of knowledge, modalities of learning that can best explain the quantum perspective of learning, applicable assumptions, and a discussion of how instruction can be organized to optimize learning. Examples of strategies that facilitate the quantum perspective of learning are provided. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Briefly, the resolution is that material particles and photons are the quanta of extended spatially continuous but energetically quantized fields. But because the resolution resides in quantum field theory and is not usually spelled out in ordinary language, it is neither generally understood nor generally taught, especially not in the context of nonrelativistic quantum physics. The purpose of this paper is to provide that resolution and to suggest that we teach introductory quantum physics from this viewpoint.",

The proposed methodology considers quantum computing as a generalized probability theory rather than a field emanating from physics and utilizes quantum programming as an educational tool to reinforce the learning process. Background: Quantum computing is a topic mainly rooted in physics, and it has been gaining rapid popularity in recent years. A need for extending the educational reach to groups outside of physics has also been becoming a necessity. Intended Outcomes: This study aims to inform academics and organizations interested in introducing quantum computing to a diverse group of participants on an educational approach. It is intended that the proposed methodology would facilitate people from diverse backgrounds to enter the field. Application Design: The introductory quantum physics content is bypassed and the quantum computing concepts are introduced through linear algebra instead. Quantum programming tasks are prepared in line with the content. Pre/post-test design method and Likert scale satisfaction surveys are utilized to measure knowledge acquisition and to evaluate the perception of the learning process by the participants. Findings: Conducted pre/post-test design survey shows that there is a statistically significant increase in the basic knowledge levels of the participants on quantum computing concepts. Furthermore, no significant difference in the gain scores is observed between the participants from different STEM-related educational backgrounds. The majority of the participants were satisfied and provided positive feedback.",

        "description":"Quantum dots (QDs) are considered useful for demonstrating quantum phenomena in undergraduate laboratories due to their monodisperse size and excellent optical properties. Although doping has an increasingly important role in QD fabrication in the semiconductor field, it has rarely been discussed in the context of the undergraduate laboratory. In this work, a simple synthesis and characterization method for Mn-doped CsPbCl[subscript 3] QDs for an upper-level undergraduate inorganic chemistry laboratory is reported. The Mn-doped CsPbCl[subscript 3] system benefits from a simplified synthesis and straightforward characterization. This experiment introduces QD research to students and offers opportunities for instructors to discuss many important concepts in inorganic chemistry, such as energy band theory, particle-in-a-box model, electron paramagnetic resonance, ligand field theory, and nanochemistry.",

They consist of a collection of 21 separate tests, each related to a different topic, and 21 diagnostic aids corresponding to the tests. The topics covered are: physical measurement, vectors, motion in one dimension, motion on a plane, dynamics, work and energy, linear momentum, oscillations, gravity and Kepler's law, waves, light-reflection and refraction, light-interference diffraction and spectra, models of light, kinetic theory of gases, static charges, electric field and potential difference, current electricity, the magnetic field, induced emf, atomic physics, and quantum physics.
