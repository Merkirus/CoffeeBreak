The approach presented by physicists differs in both perspective and substance from that encountered in chemical engineering courses where Euler's laws provide the foundation for studies of fluid and solid mechanics. Rather than ignore this difference, chemical engineering faculty should address it in a straightforward manner and connect the perspective of physicists with that of chemical engineers. This paper provides one way to make that connection.",
