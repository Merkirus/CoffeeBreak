However, there remains a lack of computational chemistry exercises available to instructors. This exercise is presented for students to develop skills using computational chemistry software while supplementing their knowledge of physical organic chemistry, specifically Hammett plots. Students use quantum calculations to determine the gas-phase Gibbs energy of ionization of substituted benzoic acids and phenols to generate a theoretical Hammett plot, thereby familiarizing themselves with the application of computational chemistry to physical organic chemistry.

        "description":"Advances in software and hardware have promoted the use of computational chemistry in all branches of chemical research to probe important chemical concepts and to support experimentation. Consequently, it has become imperative that students in the modern undergraduate curriculum become adept at performing simple calculations using computational software, interpreting computational data, and applying computational data to explain chemical phenomena. We utilize computational chemistry in a high-enrollment (&gt;1200 students/year), undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory course in a manner similar to that of organic chemistry researchers. We have employed WebMO as a web-based, easy-to-use, and free front-end interface for Gaussian09 that allows our students to complete ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) calculations throughout the curriculum. Rather than an isolated exposure to computational chemistry, our students use computational chemistry to obtain a deeper understanding of their experimental work throughout the entire semester. By integrating calculations into the curriculum, the focus moves away from performing the calculations to providing insight into chemical phenomena and understanding experimental results. We provide here both an overview of the introductory laboratory experiment and our integrated approach.",

        "description":"While computational chemistry continues to play a growing role in chemical research, issues with access and the timing of when these tools are introduced to chemistry students remain as barriers to wider interest and use. The accessibility of free software for chemical modeling has increased in recent years, promoting the inclusion of computational exercises at small undergraduate or secondary education institutions. However, as many computational chemistry methods are based on advanced theories, students are often not exposed to computational chemistry until organic or physical chemistry courses. This work looks at using an open-source code to introduce computational chemistry in first-year or introductory level courses while enhancing understanding of the Aufbau principle, electron configurations, and ionization energy. Additionally, this hands-on, interactive laboratory activity promotes important workplace skills such as collaboration, data analysis, graphical interpretation, and critical thinking.",

        "description":"The purpose of this descriptive case study was to develop pre-service chemistry teachers' Technological Pedagogical Science Knowledge (TPASK) through novel computational chemistry modules. The study consisted of two phases starting with designing a computational chemistry based learning environment followed by a case study where students' perceptions towards educational computational chemistry were explored. First, we designed an authentic research-based chemistry learning module that supported problem-based learning through the utilisation of computational chemistry methods suitable for pre-service chemistry education. The objective of the learning module was to promote learning of specific chemistry knowledge and development of scientific skills. Systematic design decisions were made through the TPASK framework. The learning module was designed for a third-year physical chemistry course taken by pre-service chemistry teachers in Chile. After the design phase, the learning module was implemented in a course, and students' perceptions were gathered using semi-structured group interviews. The sample consisted of 22 pre-service chemistry teachers. Data were analysed through qualitative content analysis using the same TPASK framework employed in the learning module design. Based on our findings, pre-service chemistry teachers first acquired Technological Scientific Knowledge (TSK) and then developed some elements of their TPASK. Besides, they highly appreciated the combination of student-centred problem-based learning and the use of computational chemistry tools. Students felt the educational computational learning environment supported their own knowledge acquisition and expressed an interest in applying similar learning environments in their future teaching careers. This case study demonstrates that learning through authentic real-world problems using educational computational methods offers great potential in supporting pre-service teachers' instruction in the science of chemistry and pedagogy. For further research in the TPASK framework, we propose there would be significant benefit from developing new learning environments of this nature and evaluating their utility in pre-service and in-service chemistry teacher's education.",

        "description":"Over the past half century, computational chemistry has evolved from a niche field to a ubiquitous pillar of modern chemical research. Driven by the increased demand for computational chemistry in research settings, the undergraduate curriculum has evolved alongside to ensure that students are well-equipped for modern research. Toward this end, many excellent computational chemistry exercises have been developed that aim to teach students what kinds of questions computational chemistry can answer and how to properly interpret the results. However, there has been far less attention given to the complexities of determining how reliable computational results are and how constraining computational scaling can be. We present an undergraduate lab exercise that uses ab initio methods to predict the combustion energy of methane. The exercise walks students through the process of benchmarking errors on a small system (methane), estimating the computational cost to perform the same analysis on a larger system (propane), and justifying an affordable yet accurate method for a hypothetical study of the larger system. Furthermore, students are introduced to other cost-saving measures like basis set extrapolation and additive corrections. The entire exercise is intentionally designed to require little technical knowledge of computational chemistry and to be flexibly grafted into a standard undergraduate curriculum. In order to ensure accessibility, the exercise utilizes the free open source software Psi4 (available on any operating system) and provides a detailed installation and use guide for completing this lab. This lab will provide students the understanding of how to properly judge, select, and justify different computational models where cost and accuracy compete, a highly desirable set of skills that generalize to any computational science.",

        "description":"Recent advances in spectroscopy and computational chemistry facilitate the introduction of current spectroscopic and computational methods at the undergraduate level. Students obtain and analyze experimental and calculated vibrational spectra (infrared and Raman) of a set of alkyne molecules to determine the role of symmetry with respect to gross selection rules. The alkyne functional group should be well-known from organic chemistry with well-resolved vibrational resonances at frequencies familiar to students. Students are able to apply concepts of symmetry, polarizability, and molecular dipoles to the analysis of experimental and computational data. A laboratory activity combining experimental infrared (IR) and Raman spectra, computational DFT methods, and analysis provides students with the ability to analyze how molecular structure and symmetry influence vibrational spectra.",

        "description":"Computational and atmospheric chemistry are two important branches of contemporary chemistry. With the present topical nature of climate change and global warming, it is more crucial than ever that students are aware of and exposed to atmospheric chemistry, with an emphasis on how modeling may aid in understanding how atmospherically relevant chemical compounds interact with incoming solar radiation. Nonetheless, computational and atmospheric chemistry are under-represented in most undergraduate chemistry curricula. In this manuscript, we describe a simple and efficient method for simulating the electronic absorption spectral profiles of atmospherically relevant molecules that may be utilized in an undergraduate computer laboratory. The laboratory results give students hands-on experience in computational and atmospheric chemistry, as well as electronic absorption spectroscopy.",
