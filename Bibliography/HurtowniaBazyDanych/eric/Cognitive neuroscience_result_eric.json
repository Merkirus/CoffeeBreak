        "description":"In recent years, several theoretical discussions as to the relationship between neuroscience and education have been held. Researchers have started to have cooperation over neuroscience and the interdisciplinary researches in which education is included. It was found that there were interactions between cognitive neuroscience and educational researches. It is thought that when the research results regarding the ones carried out on an educational dimension along with neuroscience and the application of their findings into classroom environments are included, then these research results will be given more importance. It is also considered that interdisciplinary researches such as cognitive and educational neuroscience will contribute to the understanding of how one can learn better.",

        "description":"Educational neuroscience promises to incorporate emerging insights from neuroscience into education, and is an exiting renovation of cognitive science in education. But unlike cognitive neuroscience--which aims to explain how the mind is embodied--educational neuroscience necessarily incorporates values that reflect the kind of citizen and the kind of society we aspire to create. Neuroscience can help fulfill the mandate of public education, but only as a tool that is part of a broader conversation about what schools should strive to achieve for the millions of students who attend them. I propose that educational neuroscience must advance our understanding of how knowledge is embodied in light of efforts to promote personal learning and development.",

        "description":"Purpose: This paper aims to link recent findings in cognitive neuroscience to better understand how andragogically informed instructional practices impact cognition and learning. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research questions guiding the study is in what ways can the recent findings in cognitive neuroscience help to inform adult education theory, including andragogy in particular, to deepen our understanding of how andragogical instructional principles and practices can improve learning? We adopted Torraco's (2005) integrative literature review approach of providing enough details regarding the selection of the literature and the identification and verification of emerged themes of main ideas. Findings: The core assumptions of andragogy (self-direction, prior experience, readiness to learn and immediacy of application) have a connection to the neural networks related to memory and cognition. Research Limitations/Implications: First, this study provides fundamental foundations for combining cognitive neuroscience and adult learning to illuminate how cognitive neuroscience contributes physiologically to adult learning. Second, the findings in cognitive neuroscience related to the four assumptions for andragogy help to provide scientific explanations and interpretations for adult learning theories influencing human resource development (HRD), such as self-directed learning, experiential learning and role theory. Practical Implications: First, HRD practitioners could use the integrative approach between andragogy and the cognitive neuroscience to reduce the issues of learning activities in generation differences. In addition, cognitive neuroscience research may contribute to improving teaching and instructional techniques. Originality/Value: The contributions of this study is that it provides an integrative review about why and how andragogical principles work through the lens of cognitive neuroscience. Based on the findings, we suggested a model of adaptive cognitive neuroscience-adult learning structures.",

This review is aimed at providing 1) an accessible and general overview of the research progress made in cognitive neuroscience research in understanding mathematical learning and cognition, and 2) understanding whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest that neuroscience can inform mathematics education at this point. We also highlight outstanding questions with implications for education that remain to be explored in cognitive neuroscience. The field of cognitive neuroscience is growing rapidly. The findings that we are describing in this review should be evaluated critically to guide research communities, governments and funding bodies to optimise resources and address questions that will provide practical directions for short- and long-term impact on the education of future generations.

        "description":"Investigations on the brain processes using a technology such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have led to the creation of a new field of research that bridges the gap between cognitive psychology and neuroscience: \"cognitive neuroscience.\" Within this new field, studies examining the processes of learning and developing are beginning to reveal the complex relationship between neural processes and environmental input as children develop into their socio-cultural environments. Although attempts to connect neuroscience and education have been scarce, there has been recently a wave of enthusiasm for making greater links between learning sciences. In this article, the author discusses the implications of linking neuroscience to education. The author also contends that if everyone can harness this possibility, they must exert caution and think carefully about how to proceed in order to avoid turning the role of neuroscience in education into just another \"educational fad.\" (Contains 9 notes.)",

        "description":"There is increasing interest in the application of cognitive neuroscience in educational thinking and practice, and here we review findings from neuroscience that demonstrate its potential relevance to technology-enhanced learning (TEL). First, we identify some of the issues in integrating neuroscientific concepts into TEL research. We caution against seeking prescriptive neuroscience solutions for TEL and emphasize the need, instead, to conceptualize TEL at several different levels of analysis (brain, mind and behaviour, including social behaviour). Our review emphasizes the possibility of combining TEL and neuroscience concepts in adaptive educational systems, and we consider instances of interdisciplinary technology-based interventions drawing on neuroscience and aimed at remediating developmental disorders. We also consider the potential relevance of findings from neuroscience for the development of artificial agency, creativity, collaborative learning and neural insights into how different types of multimodality may influence learning, which may have implications for the future developments of tangibles. Finally, we identify a range of reasons why dialogue between neuroscience and the communities involved with technology and learning is likely to increase in the future.",

        "author":["Bruer, John T."],
        "description":"The author is skeptical about the implications of neuroscience for education currently and into the near future. His skepticism derives from several concerns, but a common theme runs through all of them: attempts to link neuroscience with education pay insufficient attention to psychology. In this article, the author presents four variations on this theme. First, for those who are committed to developing a science-based pedagogy and solving existing instructional problems, cognitive psychology offers a mother-lode of still largely untapped knowledge. Second, attempts to link developmental neurobiology to brain development and education ignore, or are inconsistent with, what cognitive psychology tells individuals about teaching and learning. Third, cognitive neuroscience is the brain-based discipline that is most likely to generate educationally relevant insights, but cognitive neuroscience presupposes cognitive psychology and, to date, rarely constrains existing cognitive models. And fourth, the methods of cellular and molecular neuroscience are powerful, but it is not always clear that the concepts of learning and memory used by neuroscientists are the same as those used by psychologists, let alone by classroom teachers.",

        "description":"While there has been much theoretical debate concerning the relationship between neuroscience and education, researchers have started to collaborate across both disciplines, giving rise to the interdisciplinary research field of neuroscience and education. The present contribution tries to reflect on the challenges of this new field of empirical enquiry. Recently, an EARLI Advanced Study Colloquium (ASC) entitled Cognitive Neuroscience Meets Mathematics Education was held from 25-29 March 2009 in Brugge (Belgium), in which teams of cognitive neuroscientists and educational researchers presented their collaborative work. This workshop thus focussed on empirical research at the cross-roads of educational research and cognitive neuroscience within the domains of numeracy and mathematics. Taking the ASC as the background of our discussion, we present research on mathematics learning from neuroscientific as well as behavioural and educational perspectives to highlight the issues that are currently being faced in the emerging field of neuroscience and education. We contend that this field should be conceived as a two-way street with multiple bi-directional and reciprocal interactions between educational research and cognitive neuroscience. On the one hand, cognitive neuroscience might influence research in mathematics education by (a) contributing to our understanding of atypical numerical and mathematical development, (b) paving the way for setting up behavioural experiments and (c) generating findings about learning and instruction that cannot be uncovered by behavioural research alone. On the other hand, educational research affects cognitive neuroscience research by (a) helping to define the variables of interest and (b) investigating the effects of instruction on the neural correlates of learning. This interdisciplinary endeavour will allow for a better understanding of how people learn.",

In this paper, we focus our review of neuroscience research on DLEs that can potentially transform the way we view learning and instruction. We discuss recent empirical studies done on DLEs using common cognitive neuroscience methods which included eye tracking, electroencephalography (EEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

The appropriateness of these methods depends on the research question at hand. Cognitive neuroscience methods allow researchers to investigate specific cognitive processes in a very detailed way, a goal in some but not all fields of the learning sciences. This value added will be illustrated in three ways, with examples in field of mathematics learning. Firstly, cognitive neuroscience methods allow one to understand learning at the biological level. Secondly, these methods can help to measure processes that are difficult to access by means of behavioral techniques. Finally, and more indirectly, neuroimaging data can be used as an input for research on learning and instruction.

        "description":"This paper critically examines the application of research into cognitive neuroscience to educational contexts. It first considers recent warnings from within the neuroscientific community itself about the limitations of current neuroscientific knowledge and the urgent need to dispel popular &quot;neuromyths&quot; which have become accepted in many classrooms. It also criticises the use of over-simplified neuroscience to add scientific credibility to curricular reform, as has been the case in the rationale behind the recent implementation of the Northern Ireland Revised Curriculum. The paper then draws on the philosophy of Wittgenstein to highlight a further conceptual confusion which often surrounds the application of neuroscience to education.",

        "description":"This paper examines the intersection between creativity, problem solving, cognitive psychology and neuroscience in a discussion surrounding the genesis of new ideas and innovative science. Three creative activities are considered. These are (a) the interaction between visual-spatial and analytical or verbal reasoning, (b) attending to feeling in listening to the \"self\", and (c) the interaction between conscious and non-conscious reasoning. Evidence for the importance of each of these activities to the creative process is drawn from (a) historical and introspective accounts of novel problem solving by noted scientists and mathematicians; (b) cognitive psychology and neuroscience; and (c) a recent empirical study of novel mathematics problem solving. An explanation of these activities is given in terms of cognitive neuroscience. A conceptual framework connecting each of these activities is presented and the implications for learning and teaching considered. (Contains 3 figures.)",

        "description":"In recent years there has been an increasing trend in education to seek answers for best pedagogical practice in cognitive neuroscience research. This paper reviews current cognitive neuroscience research findings and critically discusses what they can potentially add to educators' pedagogy. It argues that there is a need for the development of pre-service teacher modules on the application of cognitive neuroscience research to education so that teachers can meaningfully and accurately employ any implied pedagogy. Appropriate pre-service teacher modules need to be placed within the context of major focus areas in undergraduate teacher preparation degrees; for example within educational psychology, behaviour management, special education, literacy and numeracy teaching. This is vital for non-science secondary teachers as well as those who upon entering the profession are often too busy to engage critically with the latest neuroscience research or to evaluate the many emerging textbooks that are proclaiming to be based upon the latest cognitive neuroscience findings. In this way teachers will be able to guard against &quot;neuromyths&quot; and &quot;brain-based&quot; learning claims and pedagogy that might, ultimately, be detrimental to student learning and wellbeing.",

        "description":"Recently, an interest in creativity education has increased globally. Cognitive neuroscience research of creativity has provided possible implications for education, yet few literary reviews that bridge the brain and education studies have been published. This article first introduces the definitions and behavioral measures of creativity from cognitive neuroscientists' perspectives and provides a brief overview on the brain regions and neural studies on creativity-related cognitive processes. Second, the article examines neuroscience studies on the relationship between creativity and intelligence and discusses the nature side of creativity. Third, a comprehensive review of cognitive neuroscience studies on activities that may trigger new creativity thinking is provided, followed by a discussion on the nurture side of creativity--more specifically--how these findings inform creativity education. Supportive evidence from research in cognitive psychology and education are also presented. Then the article discusses the policy implications of the findings from the literature review as they pertain to creativity skills development in formal education and training.",

        "description":"This article serves as a primer to make the neuroimaging literature more accessible to the lay reader and to increase the evaluative capability of the educated consumer of cognitive neuroscience. This special issue gives gifted education practitioners and researchers a primary source view of current neuroscience relevant to modern definitions and conceptions of giftedness while helping readers understand the methods of modern cognitive neuroscience. A second goal of this special issue is to increase readers' scientific literacy to generate a clearer understanding of both the utility and limitations of neuroimaging studies and a set of operating principles to employ when reading about neuroimaging studies from both primary and secondary sources. The potential for cognitive neuroscience to impact education has been an issue of high interest and rigorous debate, and international communities of educators and scientists have convened to explore potential intersections. Added to this, multiple and myriad definitions of giftedness make the exercise of exploring the nature of human ability and performance psychometrically and scientifically challenging.

        "description":"We have learned more about the brain in the past five years than the previous 100. Neuroimaging, lesion studies, and animal studies have revealed the intricate inner workings of the brain and learning. Synaptogenesis, pruning, sensitive periods, and plasticity have all become accepted concepts of cognitive neuroscience that are now being applied to education practice. The \"Decade of the Brain\" spawned a multitude of brain research and educational theories known as \"brain-based learning.\" There is now a movement toward evidence-based teaching as a result of the new information about cognitive neuroscience and education. Large-scale national and international initiatives continue to take place to research, disseminate, and apply brain science to education. Today, multi-disciplinary approaches to current educational practices are viewed as the best method to bridge cognitive neuroscience theory to educational practice.",

        "description":"Background: The &quot;seductive allure of neuroscience explanations&quot; (SANE) is the finding that people overweight psychological arguments when framed in terms of neuroscience findings. Aim: This study extended this finding to arguments concerning the application of psychological findings to educational topics. Sample Participants (n = 320) were recruited from the general public, specifically among English-speaking Amazon Mechanical Turk workers residing in the United States. Methods: We developed eight articles that orthogonally varied two processes (learning vs. development) with two disciplines (cognitive vs. affective psychology). We increased &quot;neuroscience framing&quot; across four levels: psychological finding alone, with an extraneous neuroscience finding (verbal), with an extraneous neuroscience finding (verbal) and graph, and with an extraneous neuroscience finding (verbal) and brain image. Participants were randomly assigned to one level of neuroscience framing and rated the credibility of each article's argument. Results: Seductive allure of neuroscience explanations effects were not ubiquitous. Extraneous verbal neuroscience framings, either alone or accompanied by graphs, did not influence the credibility of the application of psychological findings to educational topics. However, there was a SANE effect when educational articles were accompanied by both extraneous verbal neuroscience findings and brain images. This effect persisted even after controlling for individual differences in familiarity with education, attitude towards psychology, and knowledge of neuroscience. Conclusion: The results suggest that there is a SANE effect for articles about educational topics among the general public when they are accompanied by both extraneous verbal neuroscience findings and brain images.",
