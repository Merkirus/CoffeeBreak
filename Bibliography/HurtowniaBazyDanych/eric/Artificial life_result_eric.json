        "description":"Career guidance in the era of life-long learning faces challenges related to building accessible services that bridge education and employment services. So far, only limited research has been conducted on using artificial intelligence to support guidance across higher education and working life. This paper reports on development on using artificial intelligence to support and further career guidance in higher education institutions. Results from focus groups, scenario work and practical trials are presented, mapping requirements and possibilities for using artificial intelligence in career guidance from the viewpoints of students, guidance staff and institutions. The findings indicate potential value and functions as well as drivers and barriers for adopting artificial intelligence in career guidance to support higher education and life-long learning. The authors conceptualize different modes of agency and maturity levels for the involvement of artificial intelligence in guidance processes based on the results. Recommended future research topics in the area of artificially enhanced guidance services include agency in guidance interaction, developing guidance data ecosystem and ethical issues.",

        "description":"For many years, the trend in technology and engineering education has moved toward computer-oriented technologies such as robotics, programming, and computer-aided design (CAD). The concepts of automation and artificial intelligence were introduced more than six decades ago and became pervasive in daily life through actively using them in various products and services including product design, banking systems, self-driving cars, voice recognition, and language translations. Despite the importance of automation and artificial intelligence, little is known about how to teach these complex concepts to K-12 students. This article introduces the concepts of artificial intelligence and exemplar lesson ideas that integrate them with technology and engineering education contents.",

        "description":"This article uses a variety of principles of cultural-historical activity theory to extend Herbert Simon's (1996) insight into the inherent linkage between the creation of artifacts and design. We argue that design research must grapple with the doubly artificial, as the classrooms in which many educational designs are implemented are themselves already artificial and contingent--the products of design--and the learning that is the focus of investigation is already an adaptation to the classroom environment and so artificial. Focusing our discussion on the mesogenetic character of the temporal characteristics of typical educational design-based intervention research, we present an example of an 18-year-long life span of an intervention that was initially expected to last 3 or 4 years. Crises late in the life of the system, 1 of which rescued the system, 1 of which terminated it, documented through field notes written by undergraduate participants, provide evidence for the dynamics of the system's internal functioning in relation to events occurring in the larger ecology of which it was a part.",

The chemical processes that take place as paper ages appear to take different temperature-specific courses, so that it is not possible to draw any conclusions from short-term expiration at one (elevated) temperature about the long-term expiration at another (room) temperature. If artificial aging cannot be dispensed with despite this  uncertainty, aging should take place at 80 degrees Celsius and 65% relative humidity.

        "description":"The article scrutinized a friction stem in students, a false or a real of hope, struggle, and retentive in life when anxiety attacking the consciousness and bridging religious tradition and mental health status. Beyond reality to fantasy, within the inner perceptive, students construct artificial facts in the brain to stimulate action as a course of reactions. The artificial are related to a hope, an expectation, inviting a positive outcome to be believed as an alternative fact to subdue anxiety of fears, which come to overshadow students' mental status. For inner students' mental status, there is friction which pressing one to another for their artificial feeling either became the greatest power or worst nightmare affected to daily life and exposure both internally and externally reactions. A cohort effect approaches were applied to observe a longitudinal study for students' behaviors in contemplating anxiety disorder affect that relied on religious and mental health for an individual sample. Students' behaviors respect a particular characteristic as the aging process. The approaches aimed at physical features; body shape, decision making, level of aggressiveness, fears, and matting patterns. Thus, students' frictions are traceable to foresee students' mental health disorders as an umbrella from a diverse field in clinical psychology.",

        "description":"There appears to be an increasing acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across society. As people become more comfortable with AI's use in advertising, basic services and other areas of day-to-day life, the question arises will students also be willing to accept AI in learning situations. Furthermore, what are the impacts on both the student learning and acceptance as well as the effect on the instructor or professor. This paper presents the initial findings of the use of AI in grading students' discussion boards. It presents an initial model of student expectations, discusses potential benefits and drawbacks of AI and presents initial findings from a limited number of classes using AI grading.",

        "description":"As technology has become ubiquitous in learning contexts, there has been an explosion in the amount of learning data. This creates opportunities to draw on the decades of learner modelling research from Artificial Intelligence in Education and more recent research on Personal Informatics. We use these bodies of research to introduce a conceptual model for a Personal User Model for Life-long, Life-wide Learners (PUMLs). We use this to define a core set of system competency questions. A successful PUML and its interface must enable a learner to answer these by scrutinising their PUML, aided by its scaffolding interfaces. We aim to give learners both control over their own learning data and the means to harness that data for the important metacognitive processes of self-monitoring, reflection and planning. We conclude with a set of design guidelines for creating PUMLs. Our core contribution is a way to think about the design and evaluation of learning data and applications so that they give learner control and agency beyond simple data access and algorithmic transparency.",

Voice assistants incorporate AI by using cloud computing and can communicate with the users in natural language. Voice assistants are easy to use and thus there are millions of devices that incorporates them in households nowadays. Most common devices with voice assistants are smart speakers and they have just started to be used in schools and universities. The purpose of this paper is to study how voice assistants and smart speakers are used in everyday life and whether there is potential in order for them to be used for educational purposes",
