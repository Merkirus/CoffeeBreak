        "author":["Sulzinski, Michael A."],
        "description":"A novel approach is described using primary literature manuscripts for the final examination of an upper level undergraduate course in virology. This innovative technique was applied as an alternative to a core comprehensive final examination. A recent primary literature paper in virology was assigned several weeks before the end of the semester. Students were instructed to procure the electronic version of the manuscript, and to thoroughly read, highlight and outline the manuscript in advance. The examination was administered with an open book format and students were encouraged to bring laptops to access information as needed to answer questions. This primary literature-based examination format is presented here as an alternative to a comprehensive final exam. By comparing student examination scores for both final examination formats over a period of 11 years, it was determined that student performance was strong and not statistically different when compared to conventional comprehensive final examinations. Thus, the examination format described here was a useful assessment tool that provided students with valuable exposure to the discipline specific primary literature. While this article describes an application to an undergraduate virology course, the same examination techniques could be successfully applied to examinations in undergraduate or graduate classes in any areas of biochemistry and molecular biology.",

        "description":"It is an extraordinary challenge to offer an undergraduate laboratory course in virology that teaches hands-on, relevant molecular biology techniques using nonpathogenic models of human virus detection. To our knowledge, there exists no inexpensive kits or reagent sets that are appropriate for demonstrating real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in an undergraduate laboratory course in virology. Here we describe simple procedures for student exercises that demonstrate the PCR detection of an HIV target nucleic acid. Our procedures combine a commercially available kit for conventional PCR with a modification for RT-PCR using the same reagents in the kit, making it possible for an instructor with access to a LightCycler[R] instrument to implement a relevant student exercise on RT-PCR detection of HIV nucleic acid targets. This combination of techniques is useful for demonstrating and comparing conventional PCR amplification and detection with agarose gel electrophoresis, with real-time PCR over a series of three laboratory periods. The series of laboratory periods also is used to provide the foundation for teaching the concept of PCR primer design, optimization of PCR detection systems, and introduction to nucleic acid queries using NCBI-BLAST to find and identify primers, amplicons, and other potential amplification targets within the HIV viral genome. The techniques were successfully implemented at the Biology 364 undergraduate virology course at the University of Scranton during the Fall 2008 semester. The techniques are particularly targeted to students who intend to pursue either postgraduate technical employment or graduate studies in the molecular life sciences.

Students in the author's virology course helped set the learning goals, and the design and content of the exams, and developed rubrics for individual and group projects. The result was that they learned how to direct their own learning. Integrated course design and implementation of rich student learning experiences dramatically enhanced the scholarship of both students and the instructor. It allowed full immersion of the students in the course material and made the course a living entity that continued to breathe past the final exam. Particularly, learning goals linked to caring and the human dimension, which are often overlooked in the scientific curriculum, were powerful motivators and integrators. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Research and experience indicate that, although the topic is a difficult one for many students, the effectiveness of instruction is enhanced when assignments actively engage the students in the generation of scientific explanations. These authors have found that the methods and applications of virology can be effectively demonstrated using a hands-on investigative laboratory exercise. Students act as virus hunters, monitoring the presence of coliphage in various field-collected water samples by direct plaque assay. They are responsible for data collection, analysis, and interpretations of results. The purpose of this activity is to promote both content mastery and critical thinking through self-discovery. This laboratory exercise engages students to: (1) improve their scientific reasoning and communication skills; (2) determine and modify experimental protocols; (3) organize and analyze quantitative data; and (4) draw conclusions and communicate their reasoning.

        "description":"The increase in the number of international students at medical universities in Ukraine has made great demands for the quality of instruction in the first three years of study when adaptation of these students takes place. The aim of the paper is to analyse international students' perceptions of teaching Microbiology, Virology and Immunology (MBVI) at Bogomolets National Medical University and outline the recommendations. A mixed research method was applied; the questionnaire with close-ended and open-ended questions grouped in nine sets was developed. Anonymous survey was conducted with the students (N=104) after completing the MBVI course with English as a medium of instruction. The survey has indicated general satisfaction of the respondents with the course. Insufficient proficiency in English often affects the quality of learning, and a low level of the Ukrainian or Russian language skills create difficulties in their communication and effective integration to the Ukrainian cultural environment. The survey results have shown the positive attitude of the respondents to the lectures with the requirement to have more interactive communication between the lecturer and students as well as have identified the difficulties concerning practical classes and self-study. The recommendations on how to improve academic performance of international medical students have been given. The focus is on increasing and maintaining language skills, consideration of ethnic and psychological features of students from different countries and implementing interactive teaching methods so that effective interaction in the learning environment could be achieved.",

        "description":"Bacterial viruses, otherwise known as bacteriophage (or phage), are some of the most abundant viruses found in the environment. They can be easily isolated from water or soil and are ideal for use in laboratory classrooms due to their ease of culture and inherent safety. Here, we describe a series of 10 laboratory exercises where students collect, isolate, and purify the genome of an environmental phage. Once the genome has been extracted, students then clone a fragment of their isolated phage genome into a plasmid and analyze its sequence to identify the phage in their original isolate. These exercises have been carefully designed to apply foundational concepts that will expose students to basic skills in microbiology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics.",

        "description":"Several educational trials on handling viruses and or virology have been reported. However, given their small size, direct visualization of these viruses under a microscope has been rarely performed. The so-called &quot;giant viruses&quot; are larger than other viruses with a particle size greater than 200-300 nm. This enables their direct visualization under a light microscope more easily than other viruses. In this study, we developed two new types of teaching material for learning about viruses and cellular organisms using mimivirus, one of the well-known giant viruses. One teaching material involves using glass slides with enclosed mimivirus particles, and another is a paper-based teaching material, named VIRAMOS (http://tlab-edusys.azurewebsites.net/content/viramos_en.pdf). Using these, students can investigate and learn about viruses and cellular organisms.",
