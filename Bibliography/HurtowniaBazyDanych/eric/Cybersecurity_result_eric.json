        "description":"Aim/Purpose: In this study, the researchers investigated whether the out-of-class learning approach could help the students to attain any valuable learning outcomes for cybersecurity learning and could enhance the perceived value of cybersecurity education among the students. Background: Cybersecurity learning poses challenges for its students to learn a complicated subject matter and the students may be intimidated by the challenging courses in cybersecurity programs. Therefore, it is essential for the faculty members to devise some mechanisms to promote cybersecurity learning to increase its student retention. The mechanism suggested by this study was the out-of-class learning approach. Methodology: The researchers in this study employed a content analysis and adopted a semiotic method to analyze qualitative data. The researchers also conducted crosstabulation analyses using chi-square tests to detect the significant differences in the emerging learning outcomes from the two different out-of-class learning activities investigated in this study. Contribution: This study addressed the difficulty of cybersecurity education and proposed a viable mechanism to promote the student learning in such a complicated subject matter. Findings: For cybersecurity education, the out-of-class learning approach is a viable pedagogical mechanism that could lead the students to several learning outcomes, including connecting them to the real-life scenarios related to the cybersecurity profession, guiding them to their career choices and development, stimulating their intellectual growth, creating their justification of learning, and raising their cybersecurity awareness. Recommendations for Practitioners: The instructors of any cybersecurity programs should incorporate some out-of-class learning activities into the courses in their programs, especially the introductory-level courses. Additionally, it is important to coordinate the out-of-class learning activities with the in-class lessons to enable the students to justify what they have learned in their classrooms and motivate them to learn more. Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers could look beyond in-class learning and laboratory learning to investigate the impacts of out-of-class learning activities on cybersecurity education to help the students to attain better learning outcomes. Impact on Society: By promoting cybersecurity education, universities and colleges could attain a higher retention rate of the students in their cybersecurity programs. The higher retention rate of the students in cybersecurity programs would help to ease the critical shortage of cybersecurity talent. Future Research: Future research could explore the impacts of other out-of-class learning activities on cybersecurity learning; for example: job shadowing, attending cybersecurity conferences, internship, developing cybersecurity systems or tools for actual customers, working on cybersecurity research with faculty members. Additionally, future studies could investigate the effects of the out-of-class learning approach on promoting other academic programs that are characterized by intensely complex and technical nature, similar to cybersecurity programs.",

          "Jung, Yoonhyuk"],
        "description":"Cybersecurity has become an essential topic in introductory information systems (IS) core courses. As an aid to course design, the exploratory research in this paper uses a social representations lens to elucidate the perceptions of cybersecurity and cybersecurity threats held by students. Analysis of qualitative survey data from 152 students at a university in the Western U.S. identified 23 concepts forming the students' collective understanding of cybersecurity. Presented in the form of a social representations map, the findings reveal student perspectives that can be used to motivate and enhance learning about cybersecurity threats and mitigation strategies. Interpretation of the map indicates that students' sensemaking about cybersecurity places the strongest emphasis on technological concepts and socio-political concerns. In contrast, potential cybersecurity threats to national critical infrastructure are only minimally represented. The survey also examined students': (a) level of concern about different cybersecurity threats; (b) perceived likelihood they will experience given computer security incidents; and (c) incidents they have already experienced. Instructors of introductory IS courses can utilize the study findings to motivate student interest by building upon topics currently evident in the representation/frame of reference and increase student awareness and attention to cybersecurity threats that are missing. Suggested instructional design approaches, tailored to the level of awareness/prior knowledge and concern indicated include: (1) a problem-centered approach for topics related to personal cybersecurity; (2) demonstrating relevance and utilizing case studies for topics on organizational cybersecurity; and (3) collaborative, guided discovery to raise awareness about national security/critical infrastructure cybersecurity threats and protections.",

        "description":"Organizational information system users (OISU) that are victimized by cyber threats are contributing to major financial and information losses for individuals, businesses, and governments. Moreover, it has been argued that cybersecurity competency is critical for advancing economic prosperity and maintaining national security. The fact remains that technical cybersecurity controls may be rendered useless due to a lack of cybersecurity competency of OISUs. All OISUs, from accountants to cybersecurity forensics experts, can place organizational assets at risk. However, that risk is increased when OISUs do not have the cybersecurity competency necessary for operating an information system (IS). The main goal of this research study was to propose and validate, using subject matter experts (SME), a reliable hands-on prototype assessment tool for measuring the cybersecurity competency of an OISU. To perform this assessment, SMEs validated the critical knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) that comprise the cybersecurity competency of OISUs. Primarily using the Delphi approach, this study implemented four phases of data collection using cybersecurity SMEs for proposing and validating OISU: KSAs, KSA measures, KSA measure weights, and cybersecurity competency threshold. A fifth phase of data collection occurred measuring the cybersecurity competency of 54 participants. Phase 1 of this study performed five semi-structured SME interviews before using the Delphi method and anonymous online surveys of 30 cybersecurity SMEs to validate OISU cybersecurity KSAs found in literature and United States government (USG) documents. The results of Phase 1 proposed and validated three OISU cybersecurity abilities, 23 OISU cybersecurity knowledge units (KU), and 22 OISU cybersecurity skill areas (SA). In Phase 2, two rounds of the Delphi method with anonymous online surveys of 15 SMEs were used to propose and validate OISU cybersecurity KSA measures. The results of Phase 2 proposed and validated 90 KSA measures for 47 knowledge topics (KT) and 43 skill tasks (ST). In Phase 3, using the Delphi method with anonymous online surveys, a group of 15 SMEs were used to propose and validate OISU cybersecurity KSA weights. The results of Phase 3 proposed and validated the weights for four knowledge categories (KC) and four skill categories (SC). When Phase 3 was completed, the MyCyberKSAs™ prototype assessment tool was developed using the results of Phases 1-3, and Phase 4 was initiated. In Phase 4, using the Delphi method with anonymous online surveys, a group of 15 SMEs were used to propose and validate an OISU cybersecurity competency threshold (index score) of 80%, which was then integrated into the MyCyberKSAs™ prototype tool. Before initiating Phase 5, the MyCyberKSAs™ prototype tool was fully tested by 10 independent testers to verify the accuracy of data recording by the tool. After testing of the MyCyberKSAs™ prototype tool was completed, Phase 5 of this study was initiated. Phase 5 of this study measured the cybersecurity competency of 54 OISUs using the MyCyberKSAs™ prototype tool. Upon completion of Phase 5, data analysis of the cybersecurity competency results of the 54 OISUs was conducted. Data analysis was conducted in Phase 5 by computing levels of dispersion and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results of the ANOVA data analysis from Phase 5 revealed that annual cybersecurity training and job function are significant, showing differences in OISU cybersecurity competency. Additionally, ANOVA data analysis from Phase 5 showed that age, cybersecurity certification, gender, and time with company were not significant thus showing no difference in OISU cybersecurity competency. The results of this research study were validated by SMEs as well as the MyCyberKSAs™ prototype tool; and proved that the tool is capable of assessing the cybersecurity competency of an OISU. The ability for organizations to measure the cybersecurity competency of OISUs is critical to lowering risks that could be exploited by cyber threats. Moreover, the ability for organizations to continually measure the cybersecurity competency of OISUs is critical for assessing workforce susceptibility to emerging cyber threats. Furthermore, the ability for organizations to measure the cybersecurity competency of OISUs allows organizations to identify specific weaknesses of OISUs that may require additional training or supervision, thus lowering risks of being exploited by cyber threats.

        "description":"The human resource skills gap in cybersecurity has created an opportunity for educational institutions interested in cybersecurity education. The current number of schools designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and National Security Agency (NSA) as Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) to train cybersecurity experts are not sufficient to meet the shortfall in the industry. The DHS has clearly mapped out knowledge areas for cybersecurity education for both technical and non-technical disciplines; it is therefore possible for institutions not yet designated CAEs to generate cybersecurity experts, with the long-term goal of attaining the CAE designation. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the need for a top-driven, multidisciplinary approach to cybersecurity education especially at schools that have not yet been designated as Centers for Academic Excellence. The paper also suggests a multi-faceted approach and the important considerations needed to achieve a successful cybersecurity educational program.",

These ratings can be used to identify core concepts--cross-cutting ideas that connect knowledge in the discipline. The first Delphi process identified core concepts that should be learned in any first course on cybersecurity. The second identified core concepts that any cybersecurity professional should know upon graduating from college. Despite the rapidly growing demand for cybersecurity professionals, it is not clear what defines foundational cybersecurity knowledge. Initial data from the Delphi processes lay a foundation for defining the core concepts of the field and, consequently, provide a common starting point to accelerate the development of rigorous cybersecurity education practices. These results provide a foundation for developing evidence-based educational cybersecurity assessment tools that will identify and measure effective methods for teaching cybersecurity. The Delphi results can also be used to inform the development of curricula, learning exercises, and other educational materials and policies.",

Therefore, developing the strategic reasoning abilities of cybersecurity students is an important cybersecurity education learning objective. This paper proposes that basic game theory concepts should be taught to cybersecurity students in order to improve their strategic reasoning abilities. It details a pretest-posttest educational experiment that demonstrates that 2 h of basic game theory instruction results in a statistically significant improvement in students' abilities to anticipate the strategic actions of others. It also provides details of the game theory curriculum to help other cybersecurity educators replicate these results. Additionally, this paper suggests that another benefit of teaching game theory in a cybersecurity course is that it may fundamentally alter the way students view the practice of cybersecurity, helping to sensitize them to the human adversary element inherent in cybersecurity in addition to technology-focused best practices. This could result in a more naturally strategic-minded, and therefore better equipped, cybersecurity workforce.",

        "author":["Lingelbach, Kembley K."],
        "description":"Despite multiple national, educational, and industry initiatives, women continue to be underrepresented in the cybersecurity field. Only 11% of cybersecurity professionals, globally, are female. This contributes to the growing overall shortage of workers in the field. This research addressed the significant underrepresentation of females in the cybersecurity workforce. There are many practitioner and industry studies that suggest self-efficacy, discrimination and organizational culture play important roles in the low rate of women in the cybersecurity field. A limited number of scholarly studies identify causal factors; however, there is not a general consensus or framework to explain the problem thoroughly. Moreover, there exists a significant gap in theoretical framework utilizing qualitative methods to demystify the complex factors of engaging females to pursue the cybersecurity field. This study utilized a grounded theory approach to interview twelve female cybersecurity professionals to discover their perceptions of the cybersecurity field. The participants revealed strategies that could encourage females to pursue the cybersecurity field. Data analysis included a data coding process and a constant comparative method of interview transcripts. This study identified four factors of engagement and one unexpected co-factor that are perceived to have an impact on decisions to pursue the cybersecurity field. The four factors identified were awareness, support, intrinsic and extrinsic values. The interesting find of the cybersecurity mindset profile factor that is perceived to enhance the success of career trajectory warrants additional research to discover the impacts on decision to pursue the cybersecurity field. This findings of this research gives women a voice in recommending strategies to encourage other females to pursue the cybersecurity field. The findings also aid in demystifying the complexity of the factors by organizing and categorizing them in a logical sense in order to present a theoretical model to encourage females into the field of cybersecurity. Moreover, this study provides holistic insight to academicians and practitioners in developing future cybersecurity professionals. Additionally, it adds to the body of knowledge by answering the call for that additional qualitative approaches in methodology by bringing data richness and to generate new theoretical frameworks in cybersecurity research.

        "description":"Recruiting, retaining, and maintaining sufficient numbers of cybersecurity professionals in the workplace is a constant battle, not only for the technical side of cybersecurity, but also for the overlooked area of non-technical, managerial-related jobs in the cyber sector. The problem is the lack of cybersecurity skills in the European labour force. This paper presents the results of a study carried out with the aim to identify how much the cybersecurity education system within the high-level educational institutions and the industrial sector meets the needs for graduate students to gain the required cybersecurity skills. The method applied in the study is based on data collected from surveys carried out by the European competence centres on cybersecurity and the European Cybersecurity organisation. The problem of common educational program accreditation in Europe is highlighted and discussed. The actions undertaken to improve the education in both sectors are described and the emerging educational landscape is commented. The main cybersecurity knowledge specified by the industrial needs is presented in the form of five knowledge pillars. The study's findings show that there are missing topics in high-level institution's cybersecurity programs and that that there is a need to re-shape the content of the courses provided by the professional education providers.",

        "description":"The cybersecurity curriculum has grown dramatically over the past decade: once it was just a couple of courses in a computer science graduate program. Today cybersecurity is introduced at the high school level, incorporated into undergraduate computer science and information systems programs, and has resulted in a variety of cybersecurity-specific graduate programs. However, is that even enough? Is cybersecurity so broad that education needs to be more specialized? Employers want graduates who can hit the ground running: not in the broad field of cybersecurity but in some very specific areas. This paper is structured as follows. First, we will provide a brief overview of the current approaches to cybersecurity education including government standards bodies such as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework, the upcoming changes in the National Information Assurance (IA) Education and Training Programs (NIETP) Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) designation requirements, and the Department of Labor competency model. Second, we will present a framework for curriculum changes, which we use to determine the viability of information technology/information systems (IS/IT) curriculum changes to our departmental educational offerings. We examine relationships with other departments and how cybersecurity is enhanced by other domain knowledge. Then we discuss the three specialties we plan to introduce in the cybersecurity graduate curriculum: cybersecurity data analysis, cyber intelligence, and health care information security and privacy. Finally, the future cybersecurity curriculum directions are presented and discussed.",

        "description":"Using the lived experiences of study participants, the purpose of the exploratory qualitative study was to explore collegiate cybersecurity instructors' qualities needed to maximize the engagement of Generation Z cybersecurity learners to successfully become cybersecurity specialists. This understanding is important in order to increase the likelihood of Generation Z cybersecurity learners completing collegiate-level cybersecurity programs and filling the critical shortage in the cybersecurity workforce. Schwieger and Ladwig (2018) call for a better understanding of Gen Z perspectives to aid this generation's future success, and thus the problem addressed in the study is that collegiate cybersecurity instructors' qualities needed to maximize engagement of Generation Z cybersecurity learners to successfully become cybersecurity specialists have not been identified. The study explored the perceptions students had regarding the desired qualities of their cybersecurity instructors. The sample selected for this exploratory qualitative research study consisted of 10 individuals and used purposeful and snowball sampling to select study participants. Data collection was accomplished through a semi-structured interview strategy. Instructor Qualities was the first category to emerge and contained the major themes of (a) relational, (b) engaging, and (c) personable. Coursework and Learning Experiences was the second category and contained the themes of (d) real and (e) relevant. These findings can impact practice by understanding that the participants felt more engaged through touchpoints, exposure to the real, non-theoretical side of cybersecurity, understanding how their learning applied to real life, and being exposed to practitioners.

        "description":"Business schools can meet the increasingly multidisciplinary requirements of training cybersecurity professionals. But in developing curriculums, they face different cybersecurity curricular frameworks with diverse emphases. Using a meta-framework consisting of a 2x3 model and a 2x2 model, this study examines ten cybersecurity curricular frameworks and 380 associated topics and areas. It finds that most curricular frameworks examined tend to have more technical topics and are less IS/business-related. Among them, CAE-CDE is the most technically-oriented curricular framework, while CISSP has more topics that are cybersecurity-related and nontechnical. The proposed meta-model can enable business schools to evaluate cybersecurity curricular frameworks based on their own priorities and resources.",

        "description":"Cybersecurity is crucial at present because cyber threats (e.g., phishing) have become a very common occurrence in everyday life. A literature review showed that there are no studies based on cybersecurity awareness which involved a large number of Thai users. Thus, this research focused on the cybersecurity awareness of approximately 20,000 nationwide employees in a large financial institution in Thailand. The study consisted of three phases, a first phishing attack, knowledge transfer through a mixed-approach and a second phishing attack with different content. After data validation and analysis of the results, it was found that the level of cybersecurity awareness of employees improved significantly. The number of employees who opened the phishing email decreased by 71.5%. Therefore, this approach could be applied to cybersecurity enhancement in other organizations and other sectors/industries. Also, it was found that gender played a significant role in cybersecurity awareness within the Thai cybersecurity ecosystem since Thai female employees were found to have a higher level of cybersecurity awareness than male employees. Furthermore, it was found that the different generations of Thai employees (Generations Y and X and Baby Boomers) did not affect cybersecurity awareness.",

Criteria for Decision-Making&quot; considers approaches to increasing the professionalization of the nation&apos;s cybersecurity workforce. This report examines workforce requirements for cybersecurity and the segments and job functions in which professionalization is most needed; the role of assessment tools, certification, licensing, and other means for assessing and enhancing professionalization; and emerging approaches, such as performance-based measures. It also examines requirements for the federal (military and civilian) workforce, the private sector, and state and local government. The report focuses on three essential elements: (1) understanding the context for cybersecurity workforce development, (2) considering the relative advantages, disadvantages, and approaches to professionalizing the nation&apos;s cybersecurity workforce, and (3) setting forth criteria that can be used to identify which, if any, specialty areas may require professionalization and set forth criteria for evaluating different approaches and tools for professionalization. &quot;Professionalizing the Nation&apos;s Cybersecurity Workforce? Criteria for Decision-Making&quot; characterizes the current landscape for cybersecurity workforce development and sets forth criteria that the federal agencies participating in the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education--as well as organizations that employ cybersecurity workers--could use to identify which specialty areas may require professionalization and to evaluate different approaches and tools for professionalization.

        "author":["Emerick, Gerald John"],
        "description":"Despite the strong, global demand for talented workers, higher than average salaries, and relatively low education requirements (bachelor's degree) for computing fields such as cybersecurity, there continues to be a pipeline issue with graduating enough workers educated in cybersecurity to fill the demand in the United States and globally (Information Security Analysts, 2019; Morgan, 2017). At the same time, while there is significant literature related to factors that influence students to choose STEM careers more generally, there appears to be a lack of literature that addresses factors that influence students to choose a career in cybersecurity. This lack of literature limits our understanding of what interventions and programs may improve the cybersecurity pipeline issue. This study utilized a mixed-methods case study approach with the goal of providing insight into what factors influenced students in an accredited university cybersecurity program to choose cybersecurity as their career. The study also sought to better understand what aspects of cybersecurity the students found most and least interesting. Twenty-nine new cybersecurity students and 10 information systems students completed a mixed-methods survey, and five faculty at the Midwestern university were interviewed. Key findings suggest strong themes of factors that influence students to choose cybersecurity careers and these students' interests in traditional computing subjects as well as subjects specific to cybersecurity. Differences in influencing factors, interests, barriers, and obstacles amongst female and minority students suggest unique considerations and challenges.

        "description":"Much has been published about developing a cybersecurity curriculum for institutes of higher learning (IHL). Now that a growing number of IHLs globally offer such programs, a need exists on how to guide, maintain, and improve the relevancy of existing curricula. Just as cybersecurity professionals must be hone their skills continually to keep with a constantly shifting threat landscape, cybersecurity programs need to evolve to ensure they continue to produce knowledgeable graduates. In the regard, professional certifications in the cybersecurity industry offer an opportunity for IHLs to maintain a current curriculum. Governing bodies that manage professional certifications are highly motivated to ensure their certifications in assessing a candidate's overall credentials. This paper attempts to fill a void in the literature by exploring the use of professional certifications as helpful input to shaping and maintaining a cybersecurity curriculum. To this end, we offer a literature analysis that shows how changes made to professional certifications are applicable and relevant to maintaining a cybersecurity curriculum. We then provide a case study involving an undergraduate cybersecurity program in a mid-sized university in the United States. Before concluding, we discuss topics such as experiential learning, cybersecurity capstone courses, and the limitations to our approach.",
