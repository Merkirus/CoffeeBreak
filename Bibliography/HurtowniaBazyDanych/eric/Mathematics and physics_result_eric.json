        "description":"The study aimed to determine the extent of associations of physics, mathematics, and between physics and mathematics based on the results of the 2007, 2011, and 2015 Trends in Mathematics and Science Survey achievement tests. Utilizing educational data mining and correlational data analysis (significance set at [alpha] = 0.05), this study's findings revealed that there was a significant positive correlation between elementary physics and secondary physics (r = 0.821, [rho] = 0.045), between elementary mathematics and secondary mathematics (r = 0.914, ? = 0.011), between elementary physics and elementary mathematics (r = 0.914, [rho] = 0.011), and between secondary physics and secondary mathematics (r = 0.891, [rho] = 0.017). With these findings, the study concluded that physics and mathematics in elementary and high school are significantly associated that physics is not significantly associated with previous-level mathematics and that advanced courses in physics and mathematics are not associated with the secondary counterparts. Furthermore, implications toward physics education in the Philippines are formulated.",

        "description":"The relationship between physics and mathematics is reviewed upgrading the common in physics classes' perspective of mathematics as a toolkit for physics. The nature of the physics-mathematics relationship is considered along a certain historical path. The triadic hierarchical structure of discipline-culture helps to identify different ways in which mathematics is used in physics and to appreciate its contribution, to recognize the difference between mathematics and physics as disciplines in approaches, values, methods, and forms. We mentioned certain forms of mathematical knowledge important for physics but often missing in school curricula. The geometrical mode of codification of mathematical knowledge is compared with the analytical one in context of teaching school physics and mathematics; their complementarity is exemplified. Teaching may adopt the examples facilitating the claims of the study to reach science literacy and meaningful learning.",

This study investigated physics students' perceptions of post-compulsory mathematics as preparation for their degree course. 494 physics undergraduates responded to an online questionnaire about their experiences of A-level Mathematics and Further Mathematics. The findings suggest that physics undergraduates would benefit from studying Further Mathematics and specialising in mechanics during their A-level studies. As both A-level Mathematics and Further Mathematics are being reformed, universities should look closely at the benefits of Further Mathematics as preparation for their physics courses and either increase their admissions requirements, or recommend that students take Further Mathematics.",

        "description":"This study aims to explore the relationships among Turkish high school students' attitude towards physics, self-efficacy of learning physics, mathematics achievement, and physics achievement. To investigate the relationships, a unique questionnaire that identifies the attitude, self-efficacy and achievements were delivered to a total of 301 high school students. Then a hierarchical regression analysis was performed to reveal the relationships. The results of this study showed that whereas the dimensions &quot;comprehension&quot; and &quot;requirement&quot; in attitude towards physics positively and significantly predicted physics achievement, the dimensions &quot;importance&quot; and &quot;interest&quot; did not. Moreover, self-efficacy of learning physics and mathematics achievement were positive and significant predictors of physics achievement. Mathematics achievement was also the strongest positive predictor of physics achievement and this explained 18.8% of the variance in physics achievement. The students' physics achievement can be increased by developing their attitudes towards physics and self-efficacy of learning physics as well as increasing their mathematics achievement.",

        "description":"For a long time, Soviet students learned 'pure' mathematics in their mathematics classrooms, while applications of mathematics were introduced in their science (mainly physics) classrooms. This approach was a part of a uniform and rigid national curriculum. Even when in the 1990s the world was moving towards including applications in school mathematics, Russian students continued to engage in pure mathematics learning in their mathematics classrooms. It was physics teachers' responsibility to teach applications of mathematics; therefore, physics courses were highly mathematics-intensive, making extensive use of mathematics from algebra to calculus in the formulation of scientific laws and the investigation of their consequences. The collapse of the Soviet Union and some liberalization in educational policy led to changes in graduation requirements in mathematics and physics as well as diversity in mathematics and physics curricula in schools. Based on a review of textbooks, standards, curriculum documents, and other resources, in this paper we analyze changes that affected the teaching and learning of mathematics in physics classrooms in Russia from the Soviet period to the present.",

        "description":"This study explores benefits of studying two related subjects, mathematics and physics, in teacher education. German teacher students study two subjects as a major, which allows for investigating how the development of content knowledge in one subject, mathematics, benefits students' content knowledge in the other subject, physics. The sample included teacher students from 12 major teacher education universities in Germany. Each of the N = 104 physics teacher students, whose second subject was mathematics, answered two tests assessing their content knowledge in (1) mathematics and (2) physics. Our results reveal an influence of taking mathematics as a second subject on students' physics content knowledge. However, the effect size is only small. We found this influence increased over the course of study, indicating that the study of academic mathematics provided increasing opportunities to learn physics over the course of study. Even when controlling for general cognitive abilities, there remains substantial and significant effect of mathematics on physics content knowledge. Mathematical knowledge proves to be relevant in all physical subdomains except for optics and solid-state physics. Overall, the present study confirms benefits of studying physics when also studying mathematics, and thus a synergy effect in studying two subjects in scope of teacher education.",

This research focused on six variables, which is attitude towards Physics, career related to Physics, importance of Physics, difficulty of understanding Physics, Physics teachers and Physics equipment usage. The respondents consist of 203 Grade 10 students in science stream who are taking Physics as an elective subject. This research was done in secondary schools in the district of Kota Bharu, Kelantan. A questionnaire was used to gather the data regarding six aspects (24 items). The items from Prokop, Tuncer, and Chuda (2007) were translated and used to determine the students' attitude towards Physics. The findings showed a significant difference in students' interest towards Physics, career related to Physics, importance of Physics, difficulty of understanding Physics, Physics teachers and Physics equipment usage whereby the male students are higher compared to female students. Meanwhile there was no difference between students' attitude towards the importance of Physics and achievement in Additional Mathematics. There is a strong relationship between Additional Mathematics achievement and Physics achievement followed by interest towards Physics and difficulty of understanding Physics. Meanwhile the relationship between students' attitude towards career related to Physics, importance of Physics, Physics teacher and Physics equipment usage is not significant towards Physics achievement. Physics teachers should give more emphasis in not only the learning of Physics but more importantly on students' attitude towards the learning of Physics.",

        "description":"Developing expertise in physics problem solving requires the ability to use mathematics effectively in physical scenarios. Novices and experts often perceive the use of mathematics in physics differently. Students' perceptions and how they frame the use of mathematics in physics play an important role in their physics problem solving. In this study, we examined students' epistemological framing about using mathematics in physics in two types of problems: a conventional problem and a hypothetical debate problem. We found that when solving a conventional physics problem, students tended to frame problem solving in physics as rote equation chasing, i.e., plugging quantities into a memorized physics equation. In hypothetical debate problems, students were more likely to be involved in quantitative or qualitative sense making. We conclude that hypothetical debate problems might be used as an instructional tool for engaging students in sense making while using mathematics in physics. Thus, it might be potentially useful for developing more expertlike problem solving expertise.",

        "description":"This qualitative, questionnaire and interview-based study explores how pre-service physics teachers think about the role that mathematics plays in the teaching and learning of physics at university and school level and whether these views change during their pre-service teacher education. Many of the pre-service teachers were aware of the complex relationship between these two subjects at university level, noting that success in mathematics can often mask a lack of conceptual understanding in physics and that there can be a disconnect between the physics and mathematical aspects of undergraduate courses. At school level, many stressed the importance of a focus on conceptual understanding and that technical competence in mathematics lessons does not always transfer to physics lessons. Almost all the pre-service physics teachers changed their views during the year, often in response to their classroom experiences. As they became more attuned to the difficulties students faced with respect to the mathematical challenges involved in learning physics, many took a more pragmatic position that balanced the role of mathematics in physics with acceptance that they must respond to student needs. We suggest that these changing views can be framed in terms of two &quot;re-orientations.&quot; A disciplinary re-orientation where the role that mathematics plays in order to be successful in physics is reassessed, and a pedagogical re-orientation that attends to pragmatic, teaching considerations. We recommend that direct attention to the role of mathematics in school physics should be an integral part of pre-service physics teacher education in order to encourage these re-orientations.",

        "description":"This study sought answers to the question: In what ways were selected attitudes and other characteristics of college physics students related to their perceptions of physics and mathematics courses and of physics and mathematics teachers? The students were those enrolled in all sections of both the calculus and non-calculus oriented, three quarter sequenced, introductory general physics courses offered at California State Polytechnic College during Winter Quarter, 1971. The results indicated that students felt mathematics was more relevant and more palatable than physics. Physics courses were perceived as relatively low in stimulation, personal usefulness, social value, historical value, and political value. The laboratory experiences were described as not exciting  intellectually, not personally useful, and not supportive of the lectures. Students who had high school physics held decided perceptual advantages over students who had not had high school physics. (Author/TS)",

        "description":"This article addresses physics teachers' views about physics teaching in upper-secondary school. Their views have been investigated nationwide through a web-based questionnaire. The questionnaire has been developed based on several published instruments and is part of an ongoing project on the role of mathematics in physics teaching at upper-secondary school. The selected part of the results from the analysis of the questionnaire reported on here cross-correlate physics teachers' views about aims of physics teaching with their view of physics classroom activities, and perceived hindrances in the teaching of physics. Three hundred seventy-nine teachers responded to the questionnaire (45% response rate). The result indicates that teachers with a high agreement with a &quot;Fundamental Physics&quot; curriculum emphasis regarded mathematics as a problem for physics teaching, whereas teachers with high agreement with the curriculum emphases &quot;Physics, Technology and Society&quot; or &quot;Knowledge Development in Physics&quot; did not do so. This means that teachers with a main focus on fundamental theories and concepts believe that mathematics is a problem to a higher extent than teachers with main focus on the role of physics in society and applied aspects or physics knowledge development do. Consequences for teaching and further research are discussed.",
