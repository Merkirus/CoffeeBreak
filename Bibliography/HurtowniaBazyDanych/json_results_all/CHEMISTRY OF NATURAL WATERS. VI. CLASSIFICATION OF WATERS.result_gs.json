        "snippet": "A scheme is proposed for standardizing water analyses to make them directly comparable despite differences in TDS. This utilizes the molar concentrations of the acids and bases considered to be dissolved in the water and leads to a convenient diagrammatic representation of water analyses. Comparison of Natal river waters by this means shows that they possess various features in common and can be grouped together in a series of chlorided waters. Rain water and sea water also fit into this series, as do many American \u2026",
