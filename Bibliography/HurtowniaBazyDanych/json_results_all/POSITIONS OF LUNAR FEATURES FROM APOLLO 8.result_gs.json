        "snippet": "From Apollo 8 data, positions were obtained for three lunar far\u2010side features. The positions may be used to improve the accuracy of lunar far\u2010side maps. Based on these positions, the best lunar far\u2010side maps are estimated to be accurate to within 60 km (1\u03c3) in latitude and longitude. The position of an earth\u2010side feature was determined and used to evaluate the accuracy of the Apollo navigation system.",
