        "snippet": "A velocity stucture for P waves in the upper mantle has been derived from dT/d\u0394 measurements with the extended array at the Tonto Forest Seismological Observatory in Arizona. Short\u2010period P waves from earthquakes in the distance range 0 to 30 degrees have been used. Corrections for the crust underlying the array have been applied, using crustal models derived from seismic refraction and gravity data, By including later arrivals on the seismograms a fairly complete dT/d\u0394 curve has been constructed and inverted to obtain a \u2026",
